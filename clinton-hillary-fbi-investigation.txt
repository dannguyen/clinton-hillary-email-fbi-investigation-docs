   (U//FOUO) On July 10, 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) initiated a full
   investigation based upon a referral received from the US Intelligence Community Inspector
   General (ICIG), submitted in accordance with Section 811(c) of the Intelligence Authorization
   Act of 1995 and dated July 6, 2015, regarding the potential unauthorized transmission and
   storage of classified information on the personal e-mail server of former Secretary of State
   Hillary Clinton (Clinton).3 The FBI's investigation focused on determining whether classified
   information was transmitted or stored on unclassified systems in violation of federal criminal

statutes and whether classified information was compromised by unauthorized individuals, to
include foreign governments or intelligence services, via cyber intrusion or other means.
(U//FOUQ) In furtherance of its investigation, the FBI acquired computer equipment and mobile
devices, to include equipment associated with two separate e-mail server systems used by
Clinton, and forensically reviewed the items to recover relevant evidence. In response to FBI
requests for classification determinations in support of this investigation, US Intelligence
Community (USIC) agencies determined that 81 e-mail chains,15,cwhich FBI investigation
determined were transmitted and stored on Clinton's UNCLASSIFIED personal server systems,
contained classified information ranging from the CONFIDENTIAL to TOP SECRET/SPECIAL
ACCESS PROGRAM levels at the time they were sent between 2009-2013. USIC agencies
determined that 68 of these e-mail chains remain classified. In addition, the classification
determination process administered by the US Department of State (State) in connection with
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation identified approximately 2,000 additional e-mails
currently classified CONFIDENTIAL and 1 e-mail currently classified SECRET, which FBI
investigation determined were transmitted and stored on at least two of Clinton's personal server
systems.d

(U//FOUO) The FBI's investigation and forensic analysis did not find evidence confirming that
Clinton's e-mail accounts or mobile devices were compromised by cyber means. However,
investigative limitations, including the FBI's inability to obtain all mobile devices and various
computer components associated with Clinton's personal e-mail systems, prevented the FBI from
conclusively determining whether the classified information transmitted and stored on Clinton's
personal server systems was compromised via cyber intrusion or other means. The FBI did find
that hostile foreign actors successfully gained access to the personal e-mail accounts of
individuals with whom Clinton was in regular contact and, in doing so, obtained e-mails sent to
or received by Clinton on her personal account.

1. HJ/ff0F01 Clinton's Personal E-Mail Server Systems

A.       (U/fFOUO) Initial E-mail Server: June 2008 - March 2009

(U//FOU0) In or around 2007, Justin Cooper, at the time an aide to former President William
Jefferson Clinton (President Clinton), purchased an Apple OS X server (Apple Server) for the
sole purpose of hosting e-mail services for President Clinton's staff.1,2Due to concern over
ensuring e-mail reliability and a desire to segregate e-mail for President Clinton's various post­
presidency endeavors. President Clinton's aides decided to maintain physical control of the
Apple Server in the Clinton residence in Chappaqua, New York (Chappaqua residence).3,4,5
According to Cooper, in or around June 2008, a representative from Apple installed the Apple


b (U//F0UO) The number of classified e-mail chains identified may change as classification determination responses continue to
be returned to the FBI.
c (U//FOU0) For the purposes of the FBI1s investigation, an “e-mail chain” is defined as a set of e-mail responses having the
same initial e-mail. The subject line may be edited in these chains to reflect the purpose of the forward or reply.
d (U//TOUO) State did not provide a determination with respect to the classification of these e-mails at the time they were sent.
According to State Under Secretary of Management, Patrick Kennedy, unclassified information provided to State in confidence
can later be considered classified when it is “further assessed the disclosure of such information might damage national security
or diplomatic relationships.” Such information is referred to as “up-class” or “up-classified.”

Server6 in the basement of the Chappaqua residence.6,7 The FBI was unable to obtain records
from Cooper or Apple to verify the installation. At the time. Cooper was the only individual with
administrative access to the Apple Server; however, the Clinton family and their Chappaqua
residence staff had physical access to the Apple Server.8,9 The Apple Server initially hosted the
domains presidentclinton.com and wicoffice.com. which were used by President Clinton's
staff/’10,11

(U//F0 U 8 ) Prior to January 21, 2009, when she was sworn in as the US Secretary of State,
Clinton used a personally-acquired BlackBerry device with service initially from Cingular
Wireless and later AT&T Wireless, to access her e-mail accounts.12,13 Clinton initially used the
e-mail addresses hrl5@mvcin2ular.blackberrv.net and then changed to
hr 15@att.blackberry.net.14,15 According to Cooper, in January 2009, Clinton decided to stop
using her hrl 5@att.blackberrv.net e-mail address and instead began using a new private domain,
clintonemail.com. to host e-mail service on the Apple Server.16 Clinton stated to the FBI that she
directed aides, in or around January 2009, to create the clintonemail.com account, and as a
matter of convenience her clintonemail.com account was moved to an e-mail system maintained
by President Clinton's aides.17 While Cooper could not specifically recall registering the domain.
Cooper was listed as the point of contact for clintonemail.com when the domain was registered
with a domain registration services company. Network Solutions, on January 13, 2009.18,19
Clinton used her att.blackberrv.net e-mail account as her primary e-mail address until
approximately mid-to-late January 2009 when she transitioned to her newly created
hdr22@clintonemail.com account.20,21 The FBI did not recover any information indicating that
Clinton sent an e-mail from her hr 15@att.blackberrv.net e-mail after March 18, 2009.

(U//F0U©) According to Cooper, in or around January 2009 the decision was made to move to
another server because the Apple Server was antiquated and users were experiencing problems
with e-mail delivery on their BlackBerry devices.22,23 At the recommendation of Huma Abedin,
Clinton's long-time aide and later Deputy Chief of Staff at State, in or around fall 2008, Cooper
contacted Bryan Pagliano, who worked on Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign as an
information technology specialist, to build the new server system and to assist Cooper with the
administration of the new server system.24,25,26,27 Pagliano was in the process of liquidating the
computer equipment from Clinton's presidential campaign when Cooper contacted Pagliano
about using some of the campaign's computer equipment to replace the existing Apple Server at
Clinton's Chappaqua residence.28,29 Pagliano was unaware the server would be used by Clinton
at the time he was building the server system; rather, he believed the server would be used by
President Clinton's staff30 Clinton told the FBI that at some point she became aware there was a
server in the basement of her Chappaqua residence.31 However, she was unaware of the
transition from the Apple Server managed by Cooper to another server built by Pagliano and
therefore, was not involved in the transition decision.32

B.        (U/JFOUG) Second E-mail Server: March 2009 - June 2013

(U//FOUO) Between the fall of 2008 and January 2009, Pagliano requisitioned the original
hardware for the second e-mail server from Clinton's presidential campaign headquarters in
Arlington, VA.33 In addition to hardware acquired from Clinton's presidential campaign,
Pagliano and Cooper8 purchased additional necessary equipment through commercial
vendors.34,35,36,37 In March 2009, after Pagliano had acquired all of the server equipment and
installed the necessary software, he and Cooper met at Clinton's Chappaqua residence to
physically install the server and related equipment in a server rack in the Clintons'
basement.11,38,39

(U//FOUO) Once the new server system*1was physically installed and powered on, Pagliano
began migrating the e-mail data from the Apple Server to the Pagliano-administered server
system (Pagliano Server).40 Pagliano believed he “popped out” all of the e-mail from the Apple
Server and that no e-mail content should have remained on the Apple Server once the migration
took place.41 Pagliano stated to the FBT that he only transferred clintonemail.com e-mail
accounts for Abedin anq                    'rom the Apple Server and said he was unaware of and                                          b6
                                                                                                                                         b7C
did not transfer an e-mail account for Clinton.^42 However, Cooper stated to the FBI that he
believed Clinton had a clintonemail.com e-mail account on the Apple Server, and that Abedin
did not have a clintonemail.com account on the Apple Server.43 As the FBI was unable to obtain
the original Apple Server for a forensic review for reasons explained below, the FBI cannot
determine which clintonemail.com e-mail accounts were hosted on, and transferred from, the
Apple Server to the Pagliano Server.

(U//FOUO) After the e-mail account migration was completed. Cooper changed the Mail
Exchange (MX) recordsk to ensure that delivery of all subsequent e-mail to or from e-mail
addresses on the presidentclinton.com and clintonemail.com domains would be directed toward
the new Pagliano Server instead of the Apple Server.44 The Pagliano Server was only used for e-
mail management, and the FBI's review of the oldest available backup image of this server,
dated June 24, 2013, did not indicate that any e-mail users' files were stored on the Pagliano
Server.45

(U//FOU0) In March 2009, following the e-mail migration from the Apple Server to the
Pagliano Server, the Annie Server was repurposed to serve as a personal computer for household

h (LV/rOL'Q) Pagliano visited Clinton's Chappaqua residence on at least three occasions to work on the server: in March 2009, to
install the server; in June 2011, to upgrade the equipment; and in January 2012, to fix a hardware issue.
1(U//FOUO) The Pagliano Server initially consisted of the following equipment: a Dell PowerEdge 2900 server running
Microsoft Exchange for e-mail hosting and management, a Dell PowerEdge 1950 server running BlackBerry Enterprise Server
(BES) for the management of BlackBerry devices, a Seagate external hard drive to store backups of the Dell PowerEdge 2900
server, a Dell switch, a Cisco firewall, and a power supply.

Connolly LLP (Williams & Connolly), counsel for Clinton, confirmed to the Department of
Justice (DOJ) that a review of the iMac was conducted, pursuant to a request by DOJ, and no e-
mails were found belonging to Clinton from the period of her tenure as Secretary of State.

(U//FOUQ) Pagliano and Cooper both had administrative accounts on the Pagliano Server.50 At
Cooper's direction, Pagliano handled all software upgrades and general maintenance.51 Cooper
described his role as “the customer service face,” and he could add users or reset passwords on
the e-mail server.52 Cooper and Pagliano both handled the acquisition and purchase of server-
related items.53 For example, in March 2009, Cooper registered a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)1
encryption certificate at Pagliano's direction for added security when users accessed their e-mail
from various computers and devices.54,55 Clinton stated she had no knowledge of the hardware,
software, or security protocols used to construct and operate the servers.56 When she experienced
technical issues with her e-mail account she contacted Cooper for assistance in resolving those
issues.57

(U//FOUQ) Pagliano stated that a complete backup of the Pagliano Server was made on a
Seagate external hard drive once a week and a differential backup™ was completed every day,
and this continued from the initial Pagliano Server installation in March 2009 until June 2011
when the external hard drive was replaced.58 As space on the hard drive ran out, backups were
deleted on a “first in, first out” basis.59 In June 2011, Pagliano replaced the Seagate external hard
drive with a Cisco Network Attached Storage (NAS) device, to store backups of the server.60
The FBI was unable to forensically determine how frequently the NAS captured backups of the
Pagliano Server.

(U//FOUO) According to Pagliano, in early 2013, due to user limitations and reliability concerns
regarding the Pagliano Server, staff for Clinton and President Clinton discussed future e-mail
server options, and a search was initiated to find a vendor to manage a Clinton e-mail server".61
Additionally, Pagliano's expressed desire to seek new employment contributed to the decision to
move to a new server. 62 A search for the new vendor was facilitated with the assistance o:                                              b6

recalled that the transition to the PRN Server was initiated by President Clinton's aides seeking a
higher level of service than could be provided by the Pagliano Server.68 Pagliano identified
President Clinton's                                             as making the final decision to                                          b6

I (U) SSL is a security protocol used to establish an encrypted connection between a server and another machine, allowing
sensitive information such as login credentials or credit card information to be transmitted in an encrypted format instead of in
plain text. SSL certificates, issued by a third-party Certificate Authority, are small files that must be installed on servers to
establish secure sessions with web browsers.

server systems functioned together to ensure uninterrupted e-mail delivery to users.90 After
several days of migration, all e-mail accounts hosted on the presidentclinton.com, wicoffice.com,
and clintonemail.com domains were transferred to the PRN Server.q 91 At that point, PRN kept
the Pagliano Server online to ensure e-mail was still being

(U//EOUO) As part of the PRN Server environment.                    old the FBI that he configured a
backup device from Connecticut-based company Datto, Inc. (Datto), a Datto SIRIS 2000, to                b6
take multiple snapshots of the server system daily, with a retention period of 60 days.93 The           b7C
backup device also made multiple copies of the Pagliano Server between June 24, 2013 and
December 23, 2013. At the Clintons' request, PRN only intended that the backup device store
local copies of the backups.95,96 However, in August 2015, Datto informed PRN that, due to a
technicalc ----oversight,
                --
                          the PRN Server was also backing up the server to Datto's secure cloud

encrypted such that no one but the users could read the content.101 However, PRN ultimately did
not configure the e-mail settings this way to allow system administrators to troubleshoot
problems occurring within user accounts.102

(U//FOUO) PRN utilized an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)/Intrusion Prevention System
(IPS) called CloudJacket from SECNAP Network Security. The IDS/IPS device implemented
by PRN had pre-configured settings that blocked or blacklisted certain e-mail traffic identified as
potentially harmful and provided real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident response
services.104 105 SECNAP personnel would receive notifications when certain activity on the
network triggered an alert.106 These notifications were reviewed by SECNAP personnel and, at
times, additional follow-up was conducted with PRN in order to ascertain whether specific
activity on the network was normal or anomalous.107 Occasionally, SECNAP would send e-mail
notifications to|          | prompting him to block certain IP addresses. 108|           described      b6

attempt.109 PRN also implemented two firewalls for additional protection of the network.
           stated that he put two firewalls in place for redundancy in case one went down. no

(U//FOUO) According to the FBI's forensic analysis of the server system, on December 3, 2013,
Microsoft Exchange was uninstalled on the Pagliano Server.111 The Pagliano Server remained in
the same server cage at the Equinix datacenter in Secaucus, New Jersey, and a forensic review of
the server, which was obtained in August 2015 via consent provided by Clinton through
Williams & Connolly, indicated that it continued to be powered on and off multiple times before
the FBI obtained it.112 At the time of the FBI's acquisition of the Pagliano Server, Williams &
Connolly did not advise the US Government (USG) of the existence of the additional equipment
associated with the Pagliano Server, or that Clinton's clintonemail.com e-mails had been
migrated to the successor PRN Server remaining at Equinix. The FBI's subsequent investigation
identified this additional equipment and revealed the e-mail migration. As a result, on October 3,
2015, the FBI obtained, via consent provided by Clinton through Williams & Connolly, both the
remaining Pagliano Server equipment and the PRN Server, which had remained operational and
was hosting Clinton's personal e-mail account until it was disconnected and produced to the

representations made by Williams & Connolly, which stated in a February 22, 2016 letter:
“Secretary Clinton did not transfer her clintonemail.com e-mails for the time period January 21,
2009 through February 1, 2013 to her hrcoffice.com account.. ,” 123 The investigation found no
evidence Clinton's hrcoffice.com account contained or contains potentially classified
information or e-mails from her tenure as Secretary of State. The FBI has, therefore, not
requested or obtained equipment associated with Clinton's hrcoffice.com account.

(U//F0UO) Clinton stated she used a personal e-mail address and personal BlackBerry for both
personal and official business and this decision was made out of convenience.124Abedin recalled
that at the start of Clinton's tenure, State advised personal e-mail accounts could not be linked to
State mobile devices and, as a result, Clinton decided to use a personal device in order to avoid
carrying multiple devices.125                                                                I_____                                 b3

As a result, the FBI was unable to acquire or forensically examine any of these 13 mobile
devices.

obtained three of the iPads.147 148 149 Qne iPad contained three e-mails from 2012 in the

potentially classified information.151 The FBI did not recover e-mails from Clinton's personal e-
mail accounts from either of the other two iPads in its possession.152

(U//FOU0 ) Monica Hanley, a former Clinton aide, often purchased replacement BlackBerry
devices for Clinton during her tenure at State.153 Hanley recalled purchasing most of the
BlackBerry devices for Clinton from AT&T stores located in the Washington, D C. area.154

Clinton with setting up any new devices.156 According to Abedin, it was not uncommon for
Clinton to use a new BlackBerry for a few days and then immediately switch it out for an older
version with which she was more familiar.157 Clinton stated that when her BlackBerry device
malfunctioned, her aides would assist her in obtaining a new BlackBerry, and, after moving to a
new device, her old SIM cards were disposed of by her aides.158 Cooper advised he sometimes
assisted users, including Clinton, when they obtained a new mobile device by helping them back
up the data from the old device before transferring it to the new device and syncing the new
device with Clinton's server.159 Abedin and Hanley indicated the whereabouts of Clinton's
devices would frequently become unknown once she transitioned to a new device.160161 Cooper
did recall two instances where he destroyed Clinton's old mobile devices by breaking them in
half or hitting them with a hammer.162

existence of two State-issued e-mail accounts associated with Clinton; however, these accounts
were used on Clinton's behalf and not by Clinton herself. According to State, SMSGS@state.gov
was used to send e-mail messages from the Secretary to all State employees.165,166 This account
was not configured to receive e-mails, and S/ES-IRM authored the messages sent from this
account.167 S/ES-IRM created SSHRC@state.gov to manage an Outlook calendar for Clinton,
but this account was not configured to send or receive e-mails other than calendar
invitations.168 169 A May 25, 2016 report issued by the State Office of Inspector General (OIG)y
stated that, during Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, the State Foreign Affairs Manual
(FAM) required day-to-day operations at State be conducted using an authorized information
system. 170 The OIG stated it found “no evidence” that Clinton sought approval to conduct State
business via her personal e-mail account or private servers, despite her obligation to do so.171
Clinton told the FBI that she did not explicitly request permission from State to use a private
server or e-mail address.172 According to the State OIG report. State employees alleged that John
Bentel, then-Director of S/ES-IRM, discouraged employees from raising concerns about
Clinton's use of personal e-mail.z’173 When interviewed by the FBI, Bentel denied that State
employees raised concerns about Clinton's e-mail to him, that he discouraged employees from
discussing it, or that he was aware during Clinton's tenure that she was using a personal e-mail
account or server to conduct official State business.174

(U//T0U6 ) The FBI investigation determined some Clinton aides and senior-level State
employees were aware Clinton used a personal e-mail address for State business during her
tenure. Clinton told the FBI it was common knowledge at State that she had a private e-mail
address because it was displayed to anyone with whom she exchanged e-mails.175 However,
some State employees interviewed by the FBI explained that e-mails from Clinton17/;     only

majority of the State employees interviewed by the FBI who were in e-mail contact with Clinton

residence.179,180,181,182,183,184 Clinton's immediate aides, to include Mills, Abedin, Jacob

IRM in 2010 with concerns they had about Clinton1s use of a personal e-mail account and compliance with federal records
requirements. According to one staff member, the Director stated that Clinton's personal system had been reviewed and approved
by State legal staff. The Director allegedly told both staff members never to discuss Clinton1s personal e-mail system again. OIG
found no evidence that State legal staff reviewed or approved Clinton's personal e-mail system.

(U//FOUO) The FBI investigation indicated Clinton was aware her use of a personal device, e-
mail account, and server did not negate her obligation to preserve federal records. On January 23,
2009, Clinton contacted former Secretary of State Colin Powell via e-mail to inquire about his
use of a BlackBerry while he was Secretary of State (January 2001 to January 2005).bb’189 In his
e-mail reply, Powell warned Clinton that if it became “public” that Clinton had a BlackBerry,
and she used it to “do business,” her e-mails could become “official record[s] and subject to the
law.” 190 Powell further advised Clinton, “Be very careful. I got around it all by not saying much
and not using systems that captured the data.” 191 Clinton indicated to the FBI that she understood
Powell's comments to mean any work-related communications would be government records,
and she stated Powell's comments did not factor into her decision to use a personal e-mail
account.192 In an e-mail to Mills on August 30, 2011, State Executive Secretary, Stephen Mull,
cited a request from Clinton to replace her temporarily malfunctioning personal BlackBerry with
a State-issued device.193 Mull informed Mills that a State-issued replacement device for
Clinton's personal BlackBerry would be subject to FOIA requests.194 On that same day, Bentel
sent a separate e-mail to Hanley, which was later forwarded to Abedin, stating that e-mails sent
to a State e-mail address for Clinton would be “subject to FOIA searches.” 195 A State-issued
device was not ultimately issued to Clinton; in her FBI interview, Abedin stated she felt it did not
make sense to temporarily issue Clinton a State BlackBerry because it would have required
significant effort to transfer all of her e-mails and contacts to a device that she would have only
used for a few days.196 The Mull and Bentel e-mails to Mills and Hanley did not indicate that
transferring e-mail and/or contacts from Clinton's clintonemail.com account would be necessary
to issue her a State BlackBerry. 197>198>199 Abedin stated she always assumed all of Clinton's
communications, regardless of the account, would be subject to FOIA if they contained work-
related material.200

cautioned about security and records retention concerns regarding the use of personal e-mail. In
2011, a notice to all State employees was sent on Clinton's behalf, which recommended
employees avoid conducting State business from personal e-mail accounts due to information
security concerns.203 Clinton stated she did not recall this specific notice, and she did not recall
receiving any guidance from State regarding e-mail policies outlined in the State FAM.204
Interviews with two State employees determined that State issued guidance which required

have Internet connectivity on their desktop computers. During Powell1s tenure. State introduced unclassified desktop external e-

State OIG Report, IRM introduced SMART throughout State in 2009; however, the Office of the
Secretary elected not to use the SMART system to preserve e-mails, partly due to concerns that
the system would “allow overly broad access to sensitive materials.”21__________ told the FBI                               b6

that representatives from the Executive Secretariat asked to be the last to receive the SMART
rollout, and ultimately SMART was never rolled out to the Executive Secretariat Office. This
left the “print and file” method as the only approved method by which the Office of the Secretary
could preserve record e-mails.213

(U//FQE1Q) Mills wrote in a letter to State, dated December 5, 2014, that it was Clinton's
practice to e-mail State officials at their government e-mail accounts for official business, and,
therefore, State already had records of Clinton's e-mails preserved within State recordkeeping
systems. 1 14 Abedin also stated in her FBI interview that Clinton's staff believed relevant e-mails
would be captured and preservedI 1C
                                    by State if any of the senders or recipients were using an
official State e-mail account. The State OIG stated in its report that this was not an appropriate
method of preserving record e-mails, and Clinton should have preserved any record e-mails
created and received on her personal account by printing and filing the e-mails in the Office of
the Secretary.216 State OIG also determined Clinton should have surrendered all e-mails relating
to State business before leaving her post as Secretary of State.217 Clinton stated that she received
no instructions or direction regarding the preservation or production of records from State during
the transition out of her role as Secretary of State in early 2013.218 Furthermore, Clinton believed
her work-related e-mails were captured by her practice of sending e-mails to State employees'
official State e-mail accounts. 219

SCIF on Mahogany Row. ’ ’ State personnel were not authorized to bring their mobile
devices into Post 1, as it was located within the SCIF.227 According to Abedin, Clinton primarily
used her personal BlackBerry or personal iPad for checking e-mails, and she left the SCIF to do
so, often visiting State's eighth floor balcony.228 Former Assistant Secretary of State for DS Eric
Boswell stated he never received any complaints about Clinton using her personal BlackBerry

 tenure at State, Clinton's executive staff also inquired about the possibility of the Secretary using
 an iPad to receive communications in her office; however, this request was also denied due to
 restrictions associated with the Secretary's office being in a SCIF.234 According to the State OIG
 report, in January 2009, in response to Clinton's desire to take her BlackBerry into secure areas,
 Mills discussed with S/ES-IRM officials and with the State Under Secretary for Management,
 Patrick Kennedy, alternative solutions which would allow Clinton to check e-mail from her
 desk.235 Setting up an Internet-connected, stand-alone computer was discussed as a viable
 solution; however, a stand-alone system was never set up.236

 State. Thirteen individuals, consisting of State senior-level employees, work-related advisors,
 and State executive administrative staff, maintained direct e-mail contact with Clinton and
 individually e-mailed her between 100 and 1,000 times during her tenure.11Abedin, Mills, and
 Sullivan, were most frequently in e-mail contact with Clinton and accounted for 68 percent of the
 e-mails sent directly to Clinton. In addition to sending Clinton messages they wrote, Abedin,

F.       (U//FOUO) Clinton's Production of E-mail in Response to FOIA and Other Requests

(U//FOUO) The House Select Committee on Benghazi was established on May 8, 2014 and
reached an agreement with State on July 23, 2014 regarding the production of records.280 State
sent a formal request to former Secretaries of State on October 28, 2014, asking them to produce
e-mails related to their government work.281 After State requested that Clinton provide her e-
mails,1111Clinton asked her attorneys, David Kendall00 and Mills, to oversee the process of
providing Clinton's work-related e-mails to State.282 Heather Samuelson,pp an attorney working
with Mills, undertook a review to identify work-related e-mails, while Kendall and Mills
oversaw the process.283 Ultimately, on December 5, 2014, Williams & Connolly provided
approximately 55,000 pages of e-mailsqq to State in response to State's request for Clinton to
produce all e-mail in her possession that constituted a federal record from her tenure as Secretary
of State.284 State ultimately reviewed the 55,000 pages of e-mail to meet its production
obligations related to FOIA lawsuits and requests. On May 27, 2015, State received a court order
to post Clinton's e-mails to the State FOIA website on a monthly production schedule with a
completion date of January 29, 2016. State ultimately concluded its FOIA-related production
on February 29, 2016. Clinton told the FBI that she directed her legal team to provide any work-
related or arguably work-related e-mails to State; however she did not participate in the
development of the specific process to be used or in discussions of the locations of where her e-
mails might exist.286 Clinton was not consulted on specific e-mails in order to determine if they
were work-related.287

(U//FOUO) In July 2014, to initiate the review of Clinton's e-mails for production to State, Mills
arranged for             to export from the PRN Server all of Clinton's e-mails sent to or received

2014, Mills and Samuelson asked                to provide a full export of all of Clinton's e-mails
from her tenure, to include e-mails sent to and received from non-.gov e-mail addresses.294,295,296                            b6

Mills and Samuelson explained that this follow-up request was made to ensure their review

create the export of Clinton's e-mails from her tenure.301,302,303

(U//FOUQ) The FBI interviewed Samuelson on May 24, 2016 about her review of the PRN-
provided e-mails. Samuelson indicated she conducted the review of these e-mails over the course
of several months and completed it just prior to December 5, 2014, when hard copies of the
work-related e-mails were turned over to State.304Using her laptop to conduct the review,
Samuelson placed any work-related e-mails into a folder that she had created in Microsoft
Outlook.305 Samuelson first added to this folder all e-mails sent to or from Clinton's personal e-
mail account with gov and .mil e-mail addresses.306 Samuelson then searched the remaining e-
mails for the names of State senior leadership, as well as any members of Congress, foreign
leaders, or other official contacts.307 Finally, Samuelson conducted a key word search of terms
such as “Afghanistan,” “Libya,” and “Benghazi”*4,308 Samuelson reviewed the “To,” “From,”
and “Subject” fields of every e-mail during this review; however, she did not read the content of
each individual e-mail, indicating that, in some instances, she made a determination as to
whether it was one of Clinton's work or personal e-mails by only reviewing the “To,” “From,”
and “Subject” fields of the e-mail.309

(U//FOU0 ) As she completed the review, Samuelson printed all of the e-mails to be turned over
to State using a printer in Mills' s office.310 According to Samuelson, Mills and Kendall
subsequently reviewed e-mails that Samuelson printed, and any hard copy of an e-mail Mills and
Kendall deemed not to be work-related was shredded, and the digital copy of the e-mail was not
included in the folder Samuelson created in Microsoft Outlook to contain all of the work-related
e-mails.311 Mills stated that, other than instances where Samuelson requested Mills' s guidance.
Mills did not review the e-mails Samuelson identified as work-related, and once the review was
complete, Samuelson printed the work-related e-mails.312 After the review was completed,
Samuelson created a PST file containing all of the work-related e-mails and ensured that all
work-related e-mails were printed.313 This .PST file was provided to Kendall on a USB thumb

(U//FOUO) According to Hanley, in spring 2013, Cooper assisted Hanley in creating an archive
of Clinton's e-mails.315 Cooper provided Hanley with an Apple MacBook laptop (the Archive

remotely transferring Clinton's e-mails from the Pagliano Server to the laptop and a thumb

Clinton e-mail archive (one on the Archive Laptop and one on the thumb drive) were intended to
be stored in Clinton's Chappaqua and Whitehaven residences; however, Hanley explained this
did not occur as Hanley forgot to provide the Archive Laptop and the thumb drive to Clinton's

uu (U//rOUO) According to Abedin, the archive of Clinton's e-mails was created as a reference for the future production of a
book. According to Hanley, the archive of Clinton1s e-mails was created in response to Clinton1s hdr22@clintonemail.com
address being released to the public following the online posting of e-mail exchanges between Clinton and an informal political
advisor, Sidney Blumenthal. Blumenthal1s personal e-mail account, which contained his e-mails with Clinton, was compromised
on March 14, 2013 by a Romanian cyber hacker. See Section 4.D.

wanted it removed from the PRN Server.352 According to Mills, in December 2014, Clinton
decided she no longer needed access to any of her e-mails older than 60 days.353 Therefore, Mills
instructed!            to modify the e-mail retention policy on Clinton's clintonemail.com e-mail
account to reflect this change. However, according to                 he did not make these
changes to Clinton's clintonemail.com account until March 2015. 5 Clinton told the FBI that,
after her staff completed her e-mail production to State in December 2014, she was asked what
she wanted to do with her remaining personal e-mails, Clinton instructed her staff she no longer
needed the e-mails.356 Clinton stated she never deleted, nor did she instruct anyone to delete, her
e-mails to avoid complying with FOIA, State or FBI requests for information.357

zz (U//FOUO) These approximately 17,448 e-mails were determined to be unique from the e-mails provided by Williams &
Connolly as part of Clinton's production to the FBI, through a distinctive Internet Message ID. These files do not include
documents or partial e-mail files without an Internet Message ID in the metadata.
aaa (U//F0UO’) The approximate 17,448 e-mails may contain chains of e-mails in which Clinton is not on the most recent “To,’

B.     (U//FOUO) Classification Portion Markings in E-mail Recoveredfrom Personal Server
Systems

(U//F0U0) The FBI identified three e-mail chains, encompassing eight individual e-mail
exchanges to or from Clinton's personal e-mail accounts, which contained at least one paragraph
marked “(C),” a marking ostensibly indicating the presence of information classified at the
CONFIDENTIAL level. 386>387>388 The emails contained no additional markings, such as a header
or footer, indicating that they were classified. State confirmed through the FOIA review process
that one of these three e-mail chains contains information which is currently classified at the
CONFIDENTIAL level.ccc’389 State determined that the other two e-mail chains are currently
UNCLASSIFIED.390’391 State did not provide a determination as to whether any of these three e-
mails were classified at the time they were sent.

(U//FOUQ) When asked about the e-mail chain containing “(C)” portion markings that State
determined to currently contain CONFIDENTIAL information, Clinton stated she did not know
what the “(C)” meant at the beginning of the paragraphs and speculated it was referencing
paragraphs marked in alphabetical order.ddd’3 2 Clinton identified a “CONFIDENTIAL” header
and footer (inserted in the document by the FBI prior to the interview) and asked if the “(C)”
related to the “CONFIDENTIAL” header and footer.393 Clinton did not believe the content of the
e-mail was classified and questioned the classification determination.394 When asked of her
knowledge regarding TOP SECRET, SECRET, and CONFIDENTIAL classification levels of
USG information, Clinton responded that she did not pay attention to the “level” of classification
and took all classified information seriously.395

C.     (U//FOUO) Classified Information Found in Clinton's E-mails on Personal Server
Systems

(U//F0U6-) FBI and USIC classification reviews identified 81 e-mail chains containing
approximately 193 individual e-mail ex changes686that were classified from the
CONFIDENTIAL to TOP SECRET levels at the time the e-mails were drafted on
UNCLASSIFIED systems and sent to or from Clinton's personal server. Of the 81 e-mail chains
classified at the time of transmittal, 68 remain classified. Twelve of the e-mail chains, classified

bbb (U//FOUO) According to Clinton's campaign website, Clinton only provided State her work-related e-mails dated alter March
18, 2009. E-mails from January 21, 2009 to March 18, 2009 were not produced to State or the FBI by Williams & Connolly.
According to Samuelson and Mills, they were unable to locate Clinton's e-mails from this period. The e-mails from this time
period were not provided to them by PRN, and they believed the e-mails were not backed up on any server. Investigation
determined some of Clinton's e-mails from January 23, 2009 to March 17, 2009 were captured through a Datto backup on June
29, 2013. However, the e-mails obtained are likely only a subset of the e-mails sent or received by Clinton during this time
period.
ccc (U//FOUO) The three e-mail chains containing the portion mark of “(C)” are not considered as part of the group of e-mails
classified through the FBI classification review because State has not responded to the FBI request for classification
determinations for these e-mails.
ddli (U//FOUQ) Earlier in her FBI interview, when asked what the classification marking “(SBU)” meant, Clinton correctly stated
Sensitive But Unclassified.
eee (U/iFOUO) Due to the limited insight into other USG and personal e-mail accounts, the investigation was unable to determine
if e-mails from the classified e-mail chains were forwarded to other USG or personal e-mail addresses.

Individuals who worked in the State Bureau of Public Affairs111often accessed classified
information to understand the context of unclassified information that was to be disseminated
publicly.409 The Public Affairs officials primarily relied upon reporting from country desk
officers to generate talking points and believed the country desk officers were experienced in
protecting sensitive information within their reporting.410 The Public Affairs officials were also
responsible for notifying State leadership of impending reports by the news media regarding
sensitive or controversial topics.411 Furthermore, a former DOD official explained that he sent an
e-mail, since deemed to contain classified information, in order to quickly coordinate public
affairs responses by State and DOD with respect to a specific incident referenced in the e-

to Clinton. During the interview, the FBI asked Sullivan to review approximately 14 e-mails
Sullivan sent or received on unclassified systems that were later determined to contain classified
information up to the TOP SECRET/SAP level. Sullivan did not specifically recall the e-mails,
aside from recognizing some of them from the materials released pursuant to FOIA litigation, but

provided reasons why the e-mails may have been sent by him or others on unclassified
systems.458 With respect to the SAP, Sullivan stated that it was discussed on unclassified systems
due to the operational tempo at that time, and State employees attempted to talk around classified
information.459 Sullivan also indicated that, for some of the e-mails, information about the
incidents described therein may have already appeared in news reports.460 Furthermore, Sullivan
stated that his colleagues at State worked hard while under pressure and used their best judgment
to accomplish their mission.461 When forwarding e-mails, Sullivan relied on the judgment of the
individuals who sent the e-mails to him to ensure that the e-mails did not contain classified
information.462 Sullivan did not recall any instances in which he felt uneasy about information
conveyed on unclassified systems, nor any instances in which others expressed concerns about
the handling of classified information at State.000,463

(S//0C/NF) Sullivan was also asked about an e-mail exchange between him and Clinton in
which, on the morning of June 17, 2011, Clinton asked Sullivan to check on the status of talking
points she was supposed to have received.464 Sullivan responded that the secure fax was
malfunctioning but was in the process of being fixed. Clinton instructed Sullivan that if the
secure fax could not be fixed, he should “turn [the talking points] into nonpaper [with] no
identifying heading and send nonsecure.” 465 State uses the term “non-paper” to refer to a
document which is authorized for distribution to a foreign government without explicit
attribution to the U S. government and without classified information. Sullivan did not recall
this specific e-mail but believed that Clinton's request indicated that she would have wanted him                                      bl

(U//FQUO) On April 5, 2016, Abedin, who served as Deputy Chief of Staff to Clinton at State
between 2009 and 2013, was interviewed by the FBI. When asked about an e-mail subsequently
determined to contain CONFIDENTIAL information, Abedin noted that she had only conveyed
the information from the e-mail and had not originated it.470 She also stated that she relied upon
the sender to properly mark the e-mail for classification purposes and did not take it upon herself
to question the sender's judgment as to such marking.ppp>471

(U//FOUO) Investigation determined Sidney Blumenthal, a former political aide to President
Clinton and an informal political advisor to Clinton during her tenure at State, had direct e-mail
contact with Clinton during her tenure at State. FBI investigation identified at least 179 e-


000 (U//FQUO) Abedin and Mills also provided similar responses when asked about State security practices regarding classified
information.
ppp (U//TOUO) Although Abedin was a party to e-mails containing information that has since been determined to be classified,
due to the nature of her position at Slate, Abedin was not regularly included in the e-mail chains (discussed in this section of the
memorandum) about which Sullivan and Mills were questioned. Abedin's position at State did not consistently involve her
participation in substantive policy decisions, and she was not a regular user of classified e-mail systems.

    frequently found in USIC intelligence products.488,489,490 Blumenthal indicated he was not tasked
    to provide this information to Clinton; rather, he provided it because he deemed the information
    helpful, which Clinton occasionally acknowledged via e-mail.491 Clinton often forwarded the
    memos to Sullivan asking him to remove information identifying Blumenthal as the originator
    and to pass the information to other State employees to solicit their input.492,493 According to e-
    mails between Clinton and Sullivan, Clinton discussed passing the information to the White
    House, other USG agencies, and foreign governments.111,494,49

    E.     (U//FOUO) Clinton's Statements Related to Classified E-mails Found on Her Personal
    Server Systems

    (S//OC/NF) On July 2, 2016, the FBI interviewed Clinton. Clinton was aware she was an
    Original Classification Authority (OCA) at State; however, she could not recall how often she
    used this authority nor could she recall any training or guidance provided by State. Clinton
    could not give an example of how the classification of a document was determined; rather she
    stated there was a process in place at State before her tenure, and she relied on career foreign
    service professionals to appropriately mark and handle classified information.497 Clinton
    believed information should be classified when it relates to                         the use of                                   bl

    should be classified if its unauthorized release would cause damage to national security, Clinton
    responded “yes, that is the understanding. ,499

(U) (^/©C/I'ff) Clinton did not recall receiving any e-mails she thought should not have been on an
    unclassified system.500 She relied on State officials to use their judgment when e-mailing her and
    could not recall anyone raising concerns with her regarding the sensitivity of the information she
    received at her e-mail address.501 The FBI provided Clinton with copies of her classified e-mails
    ranging from CONFIDENTIAL to TOP SECRET/SAP and Clinton said she did not believe the
    e-mails contained classified information.502 Upon reviewing an e-mail classified
    SECRET//NOFORN dated December 27, 2011, Clinton stated no policy or practice existed

    qqq (U/7FOUO) The FBI obtained 177 of Blumenthal's memos from the e-mails provided by Williams & Connolly as part of
    Clinton's production to the FBI. The FBI recovered two additional memos during the investigation from BlackBerry backups
    provided by Cooper; State did not provide a classification determination on those additional memos.
    m (L7/FOUO) According to Blumenthal, “CONFIDENTIAL” meant the memo was personal in nature and did not refer to
    classified USG information.
    sss (XJ//FQUQ) According to Blumenthal, the individual who provided the content for a number of the memos authored the source
    summary statements (caveats provided regarding the source of information) in the memos.
    m (U//FOUO) Investigation was unable to determine if any of Blumenthal1s memos were forwarded to the White House, or to
    other USG agencies and foreign governments, as Sullivan's OpenNet sent items were not present in the data provided by State to
    the FBI.

do the best you could to convey the information considering the e-mail system you were
using.503 In reference to the same e-mail, Clinton believed if the foreign press was to obtain
information from that e-mail, it would not cause damage to the US Government.504 When asked,
Clinton recalled being briefed on SAP information but could not recall any specific briefing on
how to handle SAP information.505 Clinton stated she knew SAP information was of great
importance and needed to be handled carefully.506

F.        (U//FOUO) Gaps in Clinton E-mail Recoveredfrom Personal Server Systems

(U//FOU0) There were no e-mails provided by Williams & Connolly to State or the FBI dated
from January 21, 2009 to March 18, 2009. FBI investigation identified an additional 18 days
where Clinton did not provide State any responsive e-mail. FBI investigation determined 14 of
the 18 days where Clinton did not provide State any responsive e-mail correspond with e-mail
outages affecting Clinton's personal server systems as a result of both Hurricane Ireneuuu and
Hurricane Sandyvvv. FBI investigation indicated other explanations for gaps in Clinton's e-mail
production could include user deletion prior to PRN's transfer of Clinton's e-mails for review, or
flaws in the archiving and sorting process used to generate the responsive production to State.

4. (U//TOPQ) Results of the FBI Investigation and Analysis of Cyber Intrusion Potential

A.        (U//FOUO) Cyber Analysis of Clinton's Personal Server Systems

(U//FOU0) FBI investigation and forensic analysis did not find evidence confirming that
Clinton's e-mail server systems were compromised by cyber means. The FBI's inability to
recover all server equipment and the lack of complete server log data for the relevant time period
limited the FBI's forensic analysis of the server systems. As a result, FBI cyber analysis relied,
in large part, on witness statements, e-mail correspondence, and related forensic content found
on other devices to understand the setup, maintenance, administration, and security of the server
systems.

(U//FOU0-) Investigation determined Clinton's clintonemail.com e-mail traffic was potentially
vulnerable to compromise when she first began using her personal account in January 2009. It
was not until late March 2009, when the Pagliano Server was set up and an SSL certificate www
was acquired for the clintonemail.com domain—providing encryption of login credentials, but
not e-mail content stored on the server—that access to the server was afforded an added layer of
security. 507 ’508 The certificate was valid until September 13, 2013, at which time PRN obtained a
new certificate valid until September 13, 2018.509

Hurricane Sandy.
www (U//FOUO) According to FBI forensic analysis, there was no SSL certificate on the Pagliano Server between March 19,
2009, when the mail service was operational, and March 29 or 30, 2009, when the SSL certificate was installed on the server.

transition to TLS never occurred.511,512 The FBI was unable to forensically determine if TLS was
implemented on the Pagliano Server.

(U//FOUO) When asked about the maintenance and security of the server system he
administered, Pagliano stated there were no security breaches, but he was aware there were many
failed login attempts, which he referred to as brute force attacks. zzz’513 He added that the failed
attempts increased over the life of the Pagliano Server, and he set up the server's logs to alert
Cooper when they occurred.514 Pagliano knew the attempts were potential attackers because the
credentials attempting to log in did not match legitimate users on the system.515 Pagliano could
not recall if a high volume of failed login attempts emanated from any specific country.516

2008, 12 FAM 682.2-5 was amended and mandated that SBU information on non-Department-owned systems at non-
Departmental facilities had to meet certain criteria. Employees had to: 1) ensure that SBU information was enciypted; 2) destroy
SBU information on their personally owned and managed computers and removable media when the files are no longer required;
and 3) implement encryption certified by the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST), among other things. Although
12 FAM 682.2-5 was Anther amended in 2009, 2011, 2014, and 2015, the basic requirements did not change.
zzz (U) A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information, such as a password or personal identification
number (PIN). In a brute force attack, passwords may be attempted manually or automated software can be used to generate a
large number of consecutive guesses as to the targeted information.
aaaa (U) IP filtering is the practice of identifying and manually blocking IP addresses based on the identification of patterns that
are indicative of a potential attack.
bbbb (U) VPN is a private network that runs on top of a larger network to provide access to shared network resources, which may
or may not include the physical hard drives of individual computers, as in the case of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). VPN
offers an additional layer of security by encrypting the data traveling to the private network before sending it over the Internet.
Data is then decrypted when it reaches the private network.
cccc ^ Two-factor authentication is a method of confirming a user's claimed identity by utilizing a combination of two different
components, often something the user knows and something the user has—such as a RSA keyfob/token.
dddd (U) RDP is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that allows a user to remotely connect to another computer over a
network connection to view the computer and control it remotely. RDP is implemented in eveiy version of Windows starting with
Windows XP.

those who tried to gain access to the related Apple iCloud account searched for and found the e-mail address in open sources.
News articles from 2013 contained a screenshot of Blumenthal's communication with “hdr22,” thereby divulging Clinton's e-
mail alias. Other outlets mentioned the domain name in articles but withheld Clinton's e-mail alias. Clinton's full e-mail address
could therefore have been ascertained through piecing together various sources.

       mmmm(U) In order for malicious executables to be effective, the targeted host device has to have the correct program/applications
       installed. If, for example, the host is running an older version of Adobe but the exploit being used is newer, there is a chance the
       host will not be infected because the exploit was unable to execute using the older version of the program.

(U//FOU©) On or about March 14, 2013, Blumenthal's AOL e-mail account was compromised
by Marcel Lehel Lazar, aka Guccifer, a Romanian cyber hacker. Lazar disseminated e-mails and
attachments sent between Blumenthal and Clinton to 31 media outlets including a Russian
                                                                                                                                        b7E

classified at the CONFIDENTIAL level.590 Lazar was extradited from Romania to the United
States on March 31, 2016.591

(U//FOUO) Between April 25, 2016 and May 2, 2016, Lazar made a claim to FOX News that he
used information from Blumenthal's compromise as a stepping stone to hack Clinton's personal
server.592 On May 26, 2016, the FBI interviewed Lazar, who admitted he lied to FOX News
about hacking the Clinton server.593 FBI forensic analysis of the Clinton server during the
timeframe Lazar claimed to have compromised the server did not identify evidence that Lazar
hacked the server.594 An examination of log files from March 2013 indicated that IP addresses
from Russia and Ukraine attempted to scan the server on March 15, 2013, the day after the
Blumenthal compromise, and on March 19 and March 21, 2013.595 However, none of these
attempts were successful, and it could not be determined whether this activity was attributable to

(U//FOUO) FBI extracted the Thread-Index0000 and Message-IDPPPPvalues for each identified
confirmed classified e-mail relevant to this investigation. The values were extracted from the e-
mail headersqqqq in order to develop specific electronic signatures that could be used when
searching for exact references in large data repositories. In an effort to identify whether any
confirmed classified e-mails may have been compromised through computer intrusion methods,
the FBI conducted signature-based searches in available databases, to includ|                 [rr. The                                  b7E
FBI also provided the unique identifiers to other government agencies, and one entity

0000 (U) A Thread-Index value is a unique, alphanumeric, Microsoft Outlook-centric field found in an e-mail's header. The
identifier is used to track e-mail threads (or conversations). Each time there is a reply or forward in the e-mail thread, Outlook—
if it is the e-mail client being used—will append additional alphanumeric characters to the e-mail's original Thread-Index value.
pppp (U) A Message-ID is a unique identifier found in an e-mail's header. Message-IDs are required to have a specific format and

be globally unique. Unlike Thread-Index values, Message-IDs are unique to every individual e-mail, regardless of whether two e-
mails belong to the same thread (or conversation).
qqqq (jj) A header precedes the body (content text) of an e-mail, and contains lines (metadata) that identify particular routing
information. Fields such as “From.” “To.” and “Date” are mandatory, while others are optional.

responded.ssss To date, the signature-based searches in USG databases have not identified the
relevant e-mails.601




ssss (U//FQTO) The FBI provided the Executive Office of the President (EOP), State Cyber Threat Analysis Division (CTAD),
and State's Information Resource Bureau (IRB) with Thread-Index and Message-ID values. CTAD found no record of the
signatures provided. EOP stated they could only search “To,” “From,” and “Subject” lines, as did State IRB. Separately, in an
attempt to identify whether confirmed classified e-mails resided in unidentified e-mail provider accounts, or whether identified
accounts forwarded or replied to the classified messages, the FBI explored the possibility of sharing Thread-Index Value and
Message-IDs with e-mail service providers of interest. Google was asked if they could search those header fields in its dataset.
The company stated it does not index Thread-Index values, which is the identifier the FBI was most interested in, as it would
have provided insight into the extent the messages were forwarded.

               following information;

                       (U/ffiOUO) Upon taking office as the Secretary of State (SeeState) at the O.S. Department .ofState
               (hereafter. State) in January 2609, CLINTON recalled her office on the seventh floor at State headquarters
               had one Mack phone capable of unseeure and secure communications, one yellow phone for secure
               communication-only, and one white phone capable of direct calls to certain government officials.
               CLINTON, did not ha ve a computer terminal of any kind or a. facsimile machine in her office at State.
               Additionally, State out fitted CLIN'TON’S residences in Washington, DC and Chappaqua, New York with
               a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SOF). Each SOP had a combination lock that only
               CLINTON knew the combination to. The SCIFs in both residences were outfitted with secure video
               teleconference equipment, and the same phone systems as in her office at State. CLINTON did not have a
               ■computer terminal of any kind in the SCIFs at her residences, but did have a facsimile machine capable of
               .secure and unsecure transmission. CLINTON rarely used the SCIF in her residence in DC, primarily due
               to her preference to use her office at State. It was CLINTONS practice to lock the SOF every time It: was
               vacated. When in her residences, CLINTON would receive classified Information through diplomatic
               pouch via courier, secure phone call or secure lux. After consuming hard copy classilied docuntents at her
               residence, CLINTON Would place she documents in a "burn bag,"
