         (U//FOUO) On a few occasions,              J ra v e le d with CLINTON. However, the majority of

      (U//FOUO) Agents asked [                                                   a 2013 speech to the
American Foreign Service Association,




         (u//F©e©>               explained the quote was in response to a question               in regards
to how business had changed at DoS since                     ]PRESIDENT CLINTON' S administration.
             further explained that durind   [previous assignment to DoS[                 nobody at DoS
had access to unclassified systems of any sot. Blackberries didn't exist, and unclassified computer
systems were not yet installed at DoS. The only wav to communicate during that time period was via
cables and on the telephone. In contrast, when            ] returned to DoS in             lad access to
SIPRNet, JWICS, and Unclassified computers, as well as unclassified Blackberries, and secure iPads.
                          the above statement,! Kvas trying to explain how technology has allowed for a
different form of information flow, and ultimately sped up the way in which DoS does business.

         fu//Feye              further clarified                     Referenced above in| b oil
speech, was unciassified,I           was not implying that information CLINTON may havebeen
communicating classified material on her Blackberry concerning the unclassified matter.

       (U//FOUO) It was[                  {opinion that everybody at DoS takes security very seriously and
understands the importance of protecting sources and methods,                   hinks there is a
misconception about how DoS classifies documents, and further explained that generally the only way to
discuss topics with Foreign Partners is via unclassified channels, or in very sensitive cases, by making
arrangements to meet in person at Embassies or at DoS. Since there isn't a classified system that allows
DoS to communicate with its foreign counterparts, conversations that are held with foreign partners in
unclassified channels are later “up-classified” to Secret to protect the information.

        (U//FOUO) In defense of DoS practices^               Ishared a story concerning        hteraction
with then FBI Deputy Director MARK GIULIA NO, wherein             stated     I nteracted frequently with____
GIULIANO via email. |                 |stated|  [had the upmosrrespect for GIULIANO, but believed il)        |
was to review]      [inclassified email exchanges with GIULIANO.)      ^vould find emails that some would
consider sensitive.

     PRN contract with the CESC client.___________ [understood the CESC client was already using email
     domains hosted on a server out of their residence in Chappaqua, New York, and in order to effect the                                                                            be

      name                and in mid-20L                  logged in to the server at Chappaqua.

                 (U//F6«e)[                 described the physical equipment comprising the email server at the
        Chappaqua residence as a Dell PowerEdge 2900 (PowerEdge 2900) running Microsoft Exchange 2007, a
        Dell PowerEdge 1950 (PowerEdge 1950) being solely used as a BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES), a
        Cisco NSS 324 for Network Attached Storage (NAS), a switch, a firewall and a Uninterruptible Power                                                                     b6

         exclusively for email, with no file or print options. The PowerEdge 2900 had Microsoft Forefront
         security and Norton Symantec anti-virus software installed on it. No one but PAGLIANO had
          administrator rights to the PowerEdge 2900 server J             [believed the Chappaqua residence had

arranged a time to power down the equipment in Chappaqua, transport it to a data center and migrate the
existing email accounts and domains to the new server infrastructure being provided by PRN.

Level Agreement (SLA) to provide the CLINTONs with new hardware,!________________ I a PRN                     b6

employee, setup a Dell PowerEdge 620 (PowerEdge 620), two PowerConnect 2824 switches, two Fortinet
firewalls and a Datto SIRIS 2000 (DATTO), and hooked them up in a rented space at Equinix, a data
center located in Secaucus, New Jersey.

        (U//FOUO) On 06/23/2013,                  traveled to the CLINTON residence in Chappaqua and
picked up the PowerEdge 2900, the PowerEdge 1950, and the NAS, while leaving the switch, firewall and
UPS at the residence.!             Itransported the equipment to the same rented space at Equinix as the      b6
PowerEdge 620, where                  plugged in and networked all the equipment to get it back online in     b7C
order to provide CESC with continued email access.                  plugged in the NAS, but according to
               no email archiving or back-up was on it and it appeared to only have install files. The NAS
was not configured to archive email by                or PRN at any time.                changed the mail
exchanger (MX) record to specify the transition to the new IP address and configuration at Equinix.

         (U//FOU01) On or around 06/30/2013.1                Ibegan the email migration for all CESC
accounts from the PowerEdge 2900 to the PowerEdge 6201                    berformed this by right-clicking
on individual mailboxes and migrating them over one at a time.                  stated he brought over the
entire content of all the mailboxes from the PowerEdge 2900 to the PowerEdge 620 as there was no way
to do it “piece meal” or partially.___________ described the migration process as more of a “sync” and
once the servers “agree” that the mailbox is moved, the mailbox is removed from the old server, As a          be
                                                                                                              b7C
result of the migration, no email content existed on the PowerEdge 2900. During the migration, the
PowerEdge 2900 and 620 worked together in the same exchange, where the servers agree that each email
sent or received is an identical copy. Additionally,              configured the PowerEdge 620 to host a
Blackberry Enterprise Server (BES) and a Domain Controller as virtual machines,
explained the Domain Controller as being used for password and authentication requests. The PowerEdge
620 was also running Microsoft Exchange 2010 software, which was an upgrade from the software on the
PowerEdge 2900. Additionally, as part of the new server infrastructure provided by PRN,
configured the DATTO back-up device to take multiple snapshots of the server a day that purged at 60
day intervals.!___________|also configured both sets of firewalls and switches for redundancy in case one
went down. After several days of migration, the PowerEdge 620 had all email mailboxes migrated to it
and was processing email on Microsoft Exchange 2010 for the email domains presidentclinton.com,
wjcoflfice.com and clintonemail.com.l                |was “very confident” that all email had migrated from
the PowerEdge 2900 to the PowerEdge 620. At some point later,                    remembers adding the
domai n[                   ]to the PowerEdge 620. After total migration, PRN decided to keep the
PowerEdge 2900, 1950 and NAS running, even though it was no

longer processing email, in order to ensure email was being delivered without failure through the
PowerEdge 620. There was no official user security policy to have an account on the PowerEdge 620.
             Iregistered the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate for the domains hosted on the               b6
PowerEdge 620, Additionally, PAGLIANO gave___________ the credentials for the clintonemail.com                  b7C
domain, registered at Network Solutions.

        (U//FOUO) On or around 12/2013, PRN made the decision that email delivery was working well
after the migration from the PowerEdge 2900 to the PRN managed PowerEdge 620. In order to power
down the PowerEdge 2900,       ________ {stated Microsoft Exchange 2007 would need to be uninstalled            b6
from the PowerEdge 2900, or the PowerEdge 620 would generate error messages.                 I                  b7C

uninstalled Microsoft Exchange 2007 from the PowerEdge 2900 by clicking on uninstall and following
the system prompted checks to ensure there were no ties between the PowerEdge 2900 and the
PowerEdge 620 and no active mailboxes were on the PowerEdge 2900. From that point on, the
PowerEdge 2900, 1950 and NAS sat disconnected in the cage at Equinix until the FBI picked up the
PowerEdge 2900 on 08/12/2015. The uninstallation of Microsoft Exchange and powering down of the
PowerEdge 2900 was an action taken by PRN as standard protocol without order or direction from the
CESC client.

        (U//FOUO) Based on his experience.                    described PAGLIANO's set-up on the
PowerEdge 2900 as a standard email set-up.                    also described his set-up on the PowerEdge
620 as standard. Moreover.I                 Idescribed that email messages accepted by the PowerEdge 620
would first go through MX Logic, a third party company that removes viruses and spam before sending
the message through Giglinx, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) at Equinix, From there,                    |
could not recall if the email would go through CloudJacket or the firewall, but he knew they were in            be
succession. CloudJacket was an appliance used for intrusion prevention on the PowerEdge 620.                    b7C
CloudJacket had pre-configured settings that would block or blacklist certain email traffic it identified as
potentially harmful. Occasionally, CloudJacket would send email notifications to                     as the
system administrator, prompting him to block certain IP addresses. ___________ {described these
notifications as normal and could not recall any serious security incident or intrusion attempt that he was
aware of. I              Jcould not identify any IP addresses, or their country of origin, that were involved
in a brute force attack (BFA) against the PowerEdge 620. Email traffic would then go through the switch
and to the PowerEdge 620 where it would be processed by Microsoft Exchange 2010, Additionally,
               installed Trend Micro AntiVirus and later, Web root AntiVirus.

        (U//FOUOf                  stated the CESC client originally requested to encrypt email such that       be
no one but the user could read the content. This, ultimately, was not the way the email was configured so       b7C
that system administrators could troubleshoot all problems occurring within user accounts

620, although                 believed be handled almost all issues entirelyJ        Iwas seldom used, j
all, for work on CESC. System administrators could move mailboxes, change and reset passwords, and
sometimes view email for archive searches when the users didn't have the time and CESC requested PR
complete the task. After PRN took control o f the server. the CESC client never requested another
individual have administrator access.               stated B R YA N PAGLIANO’s password for the
PowerEdge 2900 was changed and he did not have access to the PowerEdge 620. The C E SC client did
request 24 hour access to someone who could assist with any issues that should arise regarding their em ail
accounts. In order to meet this request, PRN contracted with Level Platforms or Managed Workplace, a
third-party company used for troubleshooting and help desk related issues for any late night or off-hour
requests thad                could not handle. The third-party company did not have administrator access
to the server or email content, but could provide assistance with troubleshooting devices, connectivity to
the sewer and password resets.j_______         stated the help desk service was not used often and the
CESC client would contact him directly j            Iwas unsure, but thought the third party help desk
service was no longer contracted with PRN for CESC client help.

         (U//FQU&) In or around 02/2014,                  Jwas contacted by someone from CESC, that he
recalled as           Last Name Unknown (LNU), informing him that she was going to ship him a

 inventory the CESC mailboxes to determine what exists, where it was stored and how it was backed up

 the FBI, he powered it up to check for any email or backup data. The 08/2015 inventory by[
 was not requested by anyone from CESC and was a step taken by PRN.

         (u //f o u o £               stated all email accounts on the PowerEdge 620 had some back-up
 policy. Everything on the PowerEdge 620 was backed up through the DATTO device by taking several
 snapshots of the server daily and maintaining the data for 60 days. Additionally, all accounts had some
 back-up set by the user in their individual email client settings. Users could also archive email locally, by
 making .pst files on their computer workstation for example                    stated the server just presents

 not know what any CESC client individual email user's setting was. Additionally, in or around
 08/06/2015, PRN was made aware that DATTO was syncing with the DATTO cloud and storing email
 data related to CESC off-site. This off-site logging to DATTO1s datacenter was not requested by PRN or
 CESC. Once the DATTO offsite logging was discovered, DATTO disabled the offsite logging feature
 leaving DATTO with 60 days of CESC email back-up from the day it was disabled,
 believed DATTO was preserving the offsite email data.

         air/roucn                  was shown a list of CESC email accounts provided to the FBI by PRN.
                recognized most of the email accounts and knew that some were added and deleted
throughout the life of the contract, but couldn11give a timeframe for the addition/deletions and wasn't      b6
aware of all of the users for each account. Additionally]              Iwas unaware of the devices used by   b7C
each user. When CESC users would acquire a new mobile device, they could configure it themselves due
to Microsoft ActiveSync technology on the mobile device. On rare occasions,                   would have
to assist old blackberry users with synchronization with the BES.

       (U//FOtfQ ) PRN set-up a share folder on the PRN network for all documentation related to the
CESC client|              1believed PRN took this step to limit the individuals at PRN that had access to    b6

                         at the offices of Platte River Networks (PRN), 5700 Washington Street, Denver,                                      b6

the nature of the interview,                 provided the following:

        (U//FOUO) MONICA HANLEY contacted                       via email on or about February 2014
regarding email belonging to HILLARY CLINTON, The email was stored on a Macbook and CLINTON
did not want to lose the email, so HANLEY requested___________ transfer it to the Clinton Executive
Services Corporation (CESC) server (Server) managed by PRN. The Server housed four virtual                                                   b6
machines: a Microsoft Exchange server, a BlackBerry enterprise server, an administrative server, and a                                       b7C
domain controller, ___________ attempted to accomplish the task via a remote session using a remote
support application called ScreenConnect. However,                was unable to import the files using
ScreenConnect since the email was stored in the Macbook's Mail program. Therefore,                  had
HANLEY ship him the Macbook so he could import the mail files manually.

       (U//FOUO) Upon receipt of the Macbook,                       reviewed the files and noticed there
were several mail folders and each was labeled with a different year from 2009-2013. He then conducted
a Google search to identify an appropriate method for converting the Mac Mail files into .pst files.
               believed he used Gmail as a way to convert the Mac Mail files to a format that could be
imported into the Microsoft Exchange server. Once the conversion was complete, he created a new                                              b6
mailbox named HRC Archive. It was likely a regular Microsoft Exchange mailbox that could send and                                            b7c
receive email.                  did not recall who had access to the mailbox. Once the import onto the
Server was successful, he deleted the email from the Macbook, but did not use any data wiping tools on
the Macbook.                    never deleted the HRC Archive mailbox from the Server and believed it
should still exist there today; however, users with access to the mailbox could have altered its contents.

Continuation of FD-302 o f_____ Interview olj                          On 02/18/2016. Pane
        (U//FOW0) In April 2014,                Jremotely instructed                                 how to
access the HRC Archive mailbox using Microsoft Outlook on her computer,                           likely
provided this assistance using the ScreenConnect application.

         (U//FQU0) After reviewing several documents dated in and around July 23, 2014,
stated in July 2014 he had a conversation with CHERYL MILLS during which she requested
                export a .pst file with all email in CLINTON's mailbox that was sent to or received from a
.gov email address (July Export). After reviewing a list of .pst files modified in or around the same time,
               Iopined he might have attempted the July Export using different tools, such as Outlook or
PowerShell. He did not recognize the file name export.pst After completing the July Export and
verifying it would open correctly in Outlook,                 burned DVDs of the files and arranged for a
FedEx pickup the next day. However, MILLS susequently requested a secure electronic transfer of the
files instead of shipping physical media. Once the secure electronic transfer was complete,
destroyed the DVDs by breaking them in half.

        (U//FQUO) After reviewing a July 24, 2014 email from BRYAN PAGLIANO regarding a regular
expression text editor,[___________ explained when a user changes his or her email address, Outlook
updates the old email address with the new email address. MILLS was concerned CLINTON's then-
current email address would be disclosed publicly and would be different from the one CLINTON was
using at the time the emails were actually sent.              ]and PAGLIANO discussed using a regular
expression text editor to find and replace the new email address with the old, but the tool could not
accomplish the replacement.

         (U//FOUO)               used the email address[                   ]§}gmail com as an account
to test email flow when he worked on the Server, It was a “dummy” account he used to test email issues
for various PRN clients.

        (U//FO U 9) After reviewing work tickets from July 29-30, 2014,                  stated the
ScreenConnect remote sessions with MILLS and HEATHER SAMUELSON were for the purpose of
transferring copies of the July Export to their Windows workstations. Prior to the transfer]
password-protected the .pst, then placed it in an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) zip file. The
ScreenConnect tunnel was also encrypted, resulting in three layers of protection.

    (U//F0UO) After reviewing an invoice dated August 12, 2014.                              stated he assisted
SAMUELSON in reconnecting to the July Export archive.

        (U//FOUO) After reviewing a work ticket dated September 29, 2014 and invoices dated
September 30, 2014 and October I, 2014,               1stated he spoke with MILLS about the creation of
a new email archive export (September Export),                could not recall if the September Export
consisted of the complete live mailbox belonging to CLINTON, the exported emails from the HRC

 worked with SAMUELSON to reestablish her connection to an archive of CLINTON's emails.                              b6
               could not recall if it was to the July Export, the September Export, the live HRC Archive             b7C
 mailbox, or something else.

         (U//FOUO) After reviewing a work ticket dated November 24, 2014 and an email dated the same
 day£            H stated he participated in an urgent call with SAMUELSON regarding more specific                   b6
                                                                                                                     b7C
 export requirements. He could not recall the details of the conversation.

         (U//FOUO) After reviewing an administrative server log file from November 24, 2014,
[              ^explained he used Microsoft Outlook on the administrative server to test any .pst file
  exports he created for CESC. The testing consisted of opening the .pst files to ensure they loaded into
  Outlook correctly.
                                                                                                                     b6
         • Regarding Outlook Office Alert event log entries indicating a mailbox and a “gov export”                  b7C
             folder were deleted,___________ speculated they were deleted because they were no longer
             needed on the administrative server.
             Regarding the log entry referencing “huma-gmail-yahoo.pst.lnk/                    stated HUMA
             ABEDIN requested her email from Gmail and Yahoo be imported into her mailbox on the
             Microsoft Exchange server. ___________ could not recall when ABEDIN requested this
             assistance.

         (U//FOUQ) After reviewing a document where “HRC Archive” is referenced in the Windows
 Messaging Subsystem profile fori          Itmp.l          1 stated he believed this file to be a reference          b6
                                                                                                                     b7C
 related to the transfer of email from the Macbook he received from HANLEY described above.
 Specifically,                believed he used the Gmail accountr                       ~lSgmail.com to
 effect the transfer to the HRC Archive mailbox. He might have used the Macbook for this process, but
 probably used the Server.

        (U//TOUO) After reviewing emails dated December 10, 2014 and December 12, 2014, as well as
 work tickets regarding December 9-10, 2014 telephone calls with MILLS and SAMUELSON,
I              Istated they wanted the last 60 days of email for CLINTON and ABEDIN in new accounts                  b6

BleachBit on the administrative server,___________ stated he believed he used the program for the
removal of .pst files related to the various exports of CLINTON1s email discussed above from the
administrative server. He took this action of his own accord based on his normal practices as an engineer.
He did not recall which settings he used, to include the overwrite free space feature,              [ later
stated he might have used BleachBit on the Microsoft Exchange server because any .pst exports would be
created there, then moved over to the administrative server and opened to verify the exported .pst file
worked correctly.

       (U//F©t*e) ________ |does not recall who or when the conversation occurred, but someone
from CESC told him at some point s/he did not want the .pst files hanging around and wanted them off of
the Server after the export.

        (U//FOUO) After reviewing a text document with the first line “June of 2013,”|___________
stated he did not recall creating the document. However, the statement “PST Files were shredded” is
probably a reference to his use of BleachBit.

 maintenance of the Server and associated equipment.

         (U//FOUO) After reviewing an email dated August 18, 2015 with the subject “RE: email,”
               stated CESC wanted to verify they had a 60 day retention policy. He believed
               misspoke when               "[commented on a 30 day retention policy.

        (U//FOUO) After reviewing an email dated August 21, 2015 with the subject line “RE: Datto
remote access,” and an email dated August 20, 2015 with the subject line “RE: CESC Datto,”
___________ stated PRN might have received a new Datto server because in the initial setup of the
original Datto server, it auto synced with the Datto data center and created an offsite copy. The new
Datto server would not allow that to happen.

Exchange server and September 25-October 2, 2015 from the administrative server,__________
speculated he may have removed mailboxes attached to Outlook on the administrative server. He was not
instructed to delete any user mailboxes on the Microsoft Exchange server in September 2015, nor did he
delete any mailboxes. Furthermore,!                   Idid not do any work with any email exports in the
September 2015 timeframe. It was standard practice for___________ to install OnTrack PowerControls
on a server because it is required to restore a system from a Datto backup. Additionally,!
would login to the Datto server during regular maintenance appointments to check the backups.
Regarding the October visits to the CESC Datto Control Panel referenced in the logs,________           or
               probably logged into the Datto server using ScreenConnect to verify it was running
properly, ScreenConnect was                       primary method of connecting to the administrative server.

      (U//FOUO)                    did not recall manually running a disk defragmenting utility, but would
sometimes do it as part of routine maintenance.

for the CLINTON EXECUTIVE SERVICES CORPORATION (CESC). This server hosted CLINTON’s
email account, HANLEY told___________ the MacBook contained old email that only existed on the

the gmail account and used it as a bridge to move the email into a mailbox named hrcarchive on the

administrative server, and Microsoft Exchange server (PRN server). After the transfer was complete, he
deleted the content from the gmail account and provided the hrcarchive login credentials to HANLEY or
                          and demonstrated how to access the mailbox using Outlook Web Access.

the call, MILLS outlined tol                  Ishe needed an export of all
                                                                    illCLINT    n N's email sent to or
received from a .gov email address (July Export) for the purpose of pWJidr " them to the United States
Department of State (State).                |searched “*.goy” in the live “H” aailbox to find email
responsive to MILLS' request. After preparing the ex port.|                     worked with MILLSand
HEATHER SAMUELSON to transfer the export to each of their v orkstations. This interaction was the
first with MILLS.                 [previously interacted with]_________                                 and
                       MILLS served as the primary contact from which|_                  took direction for
this export and later exports,               only interacted with SAMUELSON once or twice beyond
troubleshooting her access to the exports. He described MILLS and SAMUELSON as proficient
computer users with knowledge of basic programs.

       (U//FOUO) Based on the direction provided by MILLS as described above,
prepared an export of CLINTON1s email from her live account on the PRN server                          then
used 7-Zip to compress the export and password-protect it. To transfer the export to MILLS and
SAMUELSON, he connected to each of their workstations remotely using ScreenConnect and installed 7-
Zip, On SAMUELSON's laptop he also installed Outlook 2013 because she did not have Outlook at that
time. After the installation of 7-Zip on both workstations and Outlook 2013 on SAMUELSON1s
workstation,                [transferred the zip file using Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), unzipped
the export, and opened the export in Outlook by navigating to it using File->Open->Outlook Data File.
When transferring the file,                 likely dropped it on the desktop or in a folder on the C: drive.

       (U//FOU8 ) In September 2014, MILLS contacted|                       land requested an export of
CLINTON's entire mailbox (September Export), so ___________Jfollowed a similar process to the July
Export. He prepared a .pst file, zipped it using 7-Zip, and transferred it to MILLS and SAMUELSON

through ScreenConnect. In the preparation of this export,[                 ] discussed different options for
the transfer based on the size of the file, but ultimately decided on the same process using ScreenConnect
as the July Export. MILLS never requested assistance from                      in locating CLINTON's email
from January 2009 - March 2009 and                      was never aware there was a gap during that
timeframe.

       (U//FOUO) [                 did not know why the .pst file provided to the FBI from CLINTON's
counsel contained the email address[_________________[@gmail.com in the metadata because he
believed he created email exports from CLINTON's live email mailbox. However, he provided the
following possible explanations:

                      may have imported HRC Archive into CLINTON1s live mailbox.
    ♦   A user may have moved email from HRC Archive into CLINTON1s live mailbox.
    ♦   A user may have taken email directly from the HRC Archive mailbox to produce what was
        provided to State.            ]did not assist in the production of any .pst files provided to State.

       (U//FOUO) During the July Export and September Export,|___________ (transferred one pst file,

     ♦ “HRC archive - complete.pst” references the September Export.
     ♦ “hrcarchive@clintonemail.com - HRC archive.ost” is a remnant of the transfer of files from the
         HANLEY laptop described above to gmail.

         “huma-gmail-yahoo.pst” was a result o£              importing HUMA ABED IN' s email from
         those services to the PRN server.

        (U//FOUO) After reviewing a PRN invoice referencing an October 1,2014 call with MILLS,
              stated the call was in relation to one of the .pst file transfers.

       (U//FQUQ) After reviewing a PRN work ticket dated November 18, 2014 referencing a call with
SAMUELSON,                  stated he worked with SAMUELSON to reconnect her to CLINTON1s

         (U//EOUO) After reviewing an email dated November 24, 2014 with the subject line “MMM,V
              Istated he did not know what the reference to an urgent call was about.

        (U//TOUO) After reviewing a work ticket dated November 24, 2014 referencing “more specific
export requirements.”!               1stated he did not know what the more specific export requirements
were, but did not believe an additional .pst file was transferred. Neither SAMUELSON nor MILLS
requested!               assist with searches for emails to/from specific users, emails to/from specific
domains, or create additional exports beyond the July and September Exports.

        (U//FQUQ) In November or December 2014, MILLS tolcf                          she did not want the
exported data on the laptops anymore and requested he securely delete the pst fi es previously transferred
to MILLS' and SAMUELSON's workstations, but did not specifically requestf""       ____________ |use deletion
software. Based on the request of MILLS,                     ]recommended BleachBit, a tool he had used
previously with clients who had financial information on computer equipment being decommissioned.
___________ described BleachBit as a utility that securely deletes files by overwriting data multiple
times. He could not recall what version he used, but would have downloaded the latest version at the time
of MILLS' request. Sometime prior to this discussion, MILLS mentioned once CLINTON1s emails were
printed for State, she could put the .pst file on a flash drive and have a master copy,                had the
impression MILLS was referring to all of CLINTON's emails, not just those provided to State.

         (U//F6W©)                   used the same deletion process for the workstations of both MILLS and
SAMUELSON. He initiated a remote session, typically while on the phone with MILLS or
SAMUELSON, to each workstation using ScreenConnect and downloaded BleachBit from the Internet,
then installed the software. He used BleachBit to remove the .pst files by running the shredding function
as a standard user, not an administrator, The process took a few minutes to complete during which
                did not encounter an error message.                 believed he shredded a total of eight
files - the two zip and two .pst files on each laptop from the July and September exports. He did not
recall:

    ♦ Altering any settings prior to shredding the .pst files
    ♦ Wiping free space
    ♦ Selecting artifact clean up
    ♦ Verifying the deletion of the files
    ♦ Selecting “Shred Settings and Quit” once the process was complete
    ♦ Targeting any temporary files
    ♦ Uninstalling BleachBit

         (U//FOUO) After reviewing work tickets dated December 12, 2014 and January 5, 2015,

server and the workstations of MILLS and SAMUELSON The requests from MILLS were routine
customer service, so no one else at PRN was aware of the removal tasks              1completed beyond
what was written in the work tickets. Since completion, neither MILLS nor anyone else from CESC
contacted               to verify this work was complete. Additionally,              was not contacted
by anyone to discuss the process he used to remove the files from the workstations.

        (U//FOUO) In March 2015, MILLS contacted                       to discuss CLINTON's email.
Typically, MILLS would contact                  ]using the email address___       Sigmail.com and setup a
time to call. MILLS wanted to know what backups of CLINTON1s email existed and where those
backups were located. After discussing the potential for content to exist on the server CLINTON used
prior to the PRN server, PRN decided                 Iwould travel to the datacenter in Secaucus, NJ to
power up the old equipment (Predecessor server) and check it for any backups or copies of CLINTON1s
mailbox. After                arrived at the datacenter and turned on the old equipment,!_________
spoke with                while they both were logged on to the system, Neither the Cisco Network
Attached Storage (NAS) device nor the external USB hard drive that were part of the architecture for the
Predecessor server contained backups or other data associated with CLINTON'S email.

        (U//FOUO) PRN used a Datto backup appliance to backup the PRN server and it was PRN1
common practice to include the administrative server as part of the Datto backup. butf          could
not specifically recall if the administrative server was backed up for CESC.           had no memory
of stopping Datto backups of the PRN administrative server on March 8, 2015. Datto recommends
turning off Windows Volume Shadow Copy service because it can interfere with Datto backups.

         (U//FOUO)



         (U//F0U0) After reviewing an email dated March 25, 2015 with the subject line “CESC call’ and
an email dated March 25, 2015 with the subject line “Clintons [sic],”           stated he could not
recall the content of the call or the reference to backups in the email.

 March 31, 2015.1               Istated the Platte Admin mailbox received firewall alerts and other internal
 system alerts. Additionally, the Platte Admin account was used to effect changes on other mailboxes.
___________ Idid not specifically recall using it to provide full access for prnadmin to the mailboxes H,
 HDR29, and HRC Archive on March 25, 2015 and then removing the HRC Archive mailbox from the
 Exchange server. However,___________ believed he had an “oh shit” moment and removed the HRC
 Archive mailbox. He also changed the mailbox retention policy from 30 days to 1 day, and cleaned the
 mailbox database because MILLS previously requested in late 2014 or early 2015 he change the retention
 policy for CLINTON and ABED IN' s existing and ongoing email to 60 days. He removed the HRC

Archive mailbox manually because all content in the mailbox was older than 60 days. [
changed the deleted items retention policy from 30 days to 1 day to ensure no email outside of the 60 days
remained on the server and executed the Clean-MailboxDatabase command to clean whitespace within
the database, similar to running a disk defragmentation £               also enabled Circular Logging, but
did not recall why he did so in this instance. He typically enabled it when importing email because
Microsoft Exchange logs contain email that hasn't been committed to a database. Circular Logging
reduces the log file size by forcing Exchange to commit data to the database immediately.

        (U//FOUO) After reviewing documents titled “BleachBit - PRN Admin Server” and “BleachBit -
Exchange Server” indicating the use of BleachBit on March 31,2015,|___________ plated he checked the
Exchange Server for remaining copies of CLINTON's email. When he located a .pst file, he used the
most recent non-beta version of BleachBit available at the time to shred the .pst files on the PRN server,
but did not recall which pst files he found or removed. He did not wipe free space, encountered no
errors, and viewed the folders to see if the files were gone, but did not take additional steps to confirm the
deletions.               did not talk with MILLS about the files he found and deleted.

         (U//F0UO) After reviewing log files dated March 31, 2015 indicating the deletion of files from
the Datto backup appliance,                  stated he did not recall deleting any Datto backups nor did he
recall receiving an instruction to delete backups from the Datto, however, it is unlikely anyone else at
PRN would have deleted the files,                   did not know if the administrative server was backed up
to the Datto.

       (U//TOUO) After reviewing a document titled “PRN Admin Server - Installed/Uninstalled
Application Events,’               stated he had no insight into the installation of Google Apps Sync for
Microsoft Outlook on April 5, 2015.

        (U//-FQUO) After reviewing documents titled “Add-MailboxPermission and Remove-
MailboxPermission” and “Export,pst on Admin Server - 9/25/2016 [sic],"                      stated in
September 2015 he looked into replacement options for the PRN server because he believed the server
would be turned over to the FBI. To prepare for this eventuality, he logged onto the server to verify the
backups of the server were working correctly and evaluate what new hardware PRN would need to order.
During the same time frame,                  restored the mailbox forf                     ] This
restoration may account for the activity related to Export.pst in September 2015 and it is unlikely
Export.pst contained any of CLINTON's email,                      deleted [          ] Export.pst after the
restoration was complete. However, he did not delete any data related to CLINTON's email after he was
interviewed by the FBI in September 2015.

      (U//FOUO) After reviewing an email dated March 9, 2015 referencing a preservation email from
DAVID KENDALL and a preservation request from the FBI dated July 31, 2015,___________ stated he

office telephone^               After being advised of the identity of the interviewing agents and the
nature of the interview         ___ provided the following information:

        Principal Officer Electronic Messaging System (POEMS) was a Top Secret DoS email system that
was phased out several years ago. Today the term POEMS is often used by people referring to the DoS
email systems provided by the Office of the Secretary, Office of the Executive Secretariat - Information
Resource Management (S/ES-IRM). While the majority of DoS employees receive IT support from
Information Resource Management (IRM), a subset of approximately 600 individuals receive IT support
from S/ES-IRM. This subset is composed of high-level DoS executives and staff, who are collectively
referred to as the “7th floor.” The S/ES-IRM system was created to provide the 7th floor users with
enhanced customer service.

       Despite being administered by separate groups, the IRM and S/ES-IRM systems utilize the same
hardware and software platforms. Both groups support their respective users across both Opennet, the
unclassified DoS network, and Classnet, the classified DoS network. The top secret network at DoS is
operated by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) regardless of the user.

        S/ES-IRM does not have stand-alone email backup. Historical emails have to be extracted from an
overall system backup. The volume of available historical emails therefore depends on what each user had
saved on their system when the system backup occurred. The entire S/ES-IRM system is backed up every
night during which the email exchange, as well as file servers, shared drives, applications and other
relevant files are captured. The backup tapes are held for 45 days. S/ES-IRM has pulled the relevant
S/ES-IRM system backup tapes in response to the preservation requests issued by the FBI and is
preserving them until they receive further direction from the FBI.               |estimated that
approximately 100 of the 600 S/ES-IRM customers were listed on the preservation request.

       ___________ |provided that the exchange servers are housed at ESOC in Culpeper, VA and that
the backups are stored at the Harry S. Truman building.

        S/ES-IRM customers do not use the State Messaging and Archival Retrieval Tool (SMART) for
memorializing official email records. Instead, they follow the “print and file” policy whereby each
individual is responsible for assessing if a communication should be archived and is then responsible for
printing and appropriately filing the communication. SMART is primarily used for archiving cable traffic
and replaced a legacy system known as Cablexpress approximately four or five years ago.

       S/ES-IRM does not administer the Public Affairs Communication Electronically (PACE) system,
which is operated by the Bureau of Diplomacy. PACE is a much smaller system but it is possible that a
few people from Secretary Clinton's staff may have used PACE.

       DoS does not have a restriction on the use of personal email accounts for official business.
Personal email accounts are often used by individuals in the field who were not issued an official DoS
mobile device, or who do not have the time or means to remotely log into the DoS system. Employees are
not required to notify DoS that they are using a personal account for official business and there is no
mechanism to track who is using a personal email account. In 2009 and 2014, DoS issued official
guidance to users of personal email accounts that stipulated that they must forward work-related emails
back to their official work account within a specified period of time for record keeping purposes.

        S/ES-IRM does not automatically create Opennet or Classnet email accounts for new employees.
Accounts are only created once a request form has been submitted. S/ES-IRM had no record of a request
being completed by, or on behalf of. Secretary Clinton for the creation of DoS email accounts. Nor were
there any records of requests being made for a DoS mobile device.

        S/ES-IRM is also responsible for issuing official cell phones and other mobile devices to their 7th
floor customers. However, S/ES-IRM does not have historical records for devices issued during Secretary
Clinton1s tenure. The system that was used for tracking property during that time period was previously
taken offline and S/ES-IRM has been unable to restore the system due to the presence of corrupt files.

        (U//FOUO) On January 11, 2016, MONICA HANLEY was 'mtervlewedbv Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBD Special Agents!"                land                    \at\                       \                              ^

interview, were|                 "land!                \ After being advised of tbe identities of tbe
interviewing agents, and the purpose of the interview, HANLEY provided the following information-.

                (U//rOUO) In 2003, following her college graduation, HANLEY interned for then Senator
HILLARY CLINTON. HANLEY's internship position was converted to a permanent position in 2004.
HANLEY continued working for New York Senator KIRSTEN G1LLIBRAND, who was appointed after
CLINTON was nominated as Secretary of State.

        (U//F0U0) In April of 2009, HANLEY received a call from HUM A ABEDIN asking if
HANLEY would be interested in working for CLINTON as a “Confidential Assistant” at the department
of State (DoS). HANLEY accepted the position at DoS, and continued working for GILL1BRAND until
two days before her start at DoS.

        (U//FOUO) During her first year at DoS, HANLEY* s “Confidential Assistant” duties included
supporting and scheduling CLINTON, domestic travel and personal appointments. HANLEY also ran
various errands for CLINTON. HANLEY also served as ABEDIN and JAKE SVJLLYV AN's scheduler,
and it was her responsibility to coordinate their schedules with CLINTON's schedule.

        (U//F0UQ) HANLEY accompanied CLINTON on foreign travel on a few occasions during her
first year at DoS. HANLEY1s first overseas DoS travel with CLINTON was to the Philippines.
CLINTON specifically invited HANLEY to join her on that trip because CLINTON knew HANLEY was
of Filipino decent and would appreciate the opportunity to travel there. ABEDIN almost always traveled
with CLINTON. [ ~                                              \were additional aids who rotated duties
with HANLEY in regards to accompanying CLINTON on foreign travel.

       (U//F0UO) When ABEDIN became pregnant in 2011, HANLEY became a primary traveler and
accompanied CLINTON on most of her foreign trios.!                                             \ and
                  Jwere also part of CLINTON* s travel team_____ _________

                                                                                         _
       (U//FOUO) HANLEY went through a full day of on board training her first day at DoS, of which
approximately half was security related. HANLEY recalled learning specifically how to handle and
transport classified information/paper, but could not recall who provided the training. HANLEY received
a Top Secret/SCI clearance at DoS, but was unsure of any specific codeword programs for which she may
have additionally received read-ins. HANLEY did not hold a security clearance prior to DoS.

        (U//FQUO) HANLEY did not recall ever receiving Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) training,
and the only training HANLEY received concerning the Federal Records Act (FRA) came near the end of
CLINTON's tenure at DoS. A representative from DoS' s record keeping office,___________ Last Name         b6
                                                                                                          b7C
Unknown (LNU), met with HANLEY and others on CLINTON's staff and instructed them to produce all
records that “changed, effected, or created policy.” HANLEY recalled going through paper files with
other executive Staff members, and placing the papers in stacks in the hallway outside the Secretary's
Suite. After which, a DoS record keeper would review the production and make the final determination
on which information was relevant to the FRA.

Email Accounts and Server

      (U//FOUO) During her time in the Senate, CLINTON used hr 13foiatt.blackberry.net. HANLEY
was aware of this email account, but did not use this account to communicate with CLINTON.

      (U//FOUO) CLINTON used hrod 17@cIintonemail.corn while she was Secretary of State, and
hdr22@ dlmonemail.eom following her departure from DoS.
                                                                                                          b6
        (U//FOUO) HANLEY did not initially recall the account          fcgmasl. :om, however, later in
                                                                                                          b7C
the interview HANLEY deduced the             a&mail com account may have been created as a way to
communicate with CLINTON during a bad storm in 2011 when power to the server hosting
hdr22@dlmonemaii.com was lost. HA' S1LEY believed CLINTON was traveling in Croatia at the time,
and HANLEY and                     may have created the account as a temporary way to communicate
with CLINTON during the outage.

        (U//FOUO) HANLEY was not familiar with the email address SSHR€@stat&.gov. HANLEY
vaguely recalled CLINTON being issued a DoS Blackberry, but CLINTON did not use the DoS issued
device.

        (U//FOU0) HANLEY was aware CLINTON was using a personal email address on a personal
server for DoS business while CLINTON was Secretary of State. JUSTIN COOPER created, installed,
and maintained the server in Chappaqua before the server was transitioned over to Platte River Networks
(PRN). HANLEY could not recall when the transition to PRN occurred. COOPER was HANLEY's
point of contact for assistance in regards to syncing CLINTON's mobile devices to the server. Anytime
CLINTON got a new device, HANLEY would contact COOPER who would troubleshoot her through the
process of setting up the new device with the server. COOPER was also HANLEY1s point of contact
FD-3()2a (Rev. 10-6-95)




Continual ion of FD-302 o f______ Interview of Monica i lanicv_____________. On 1/11/2016 . Page   3_______


when needed reimbursment for items she purchased for CLINTON. COOPER was located in New York,
so most of HANLEY1s interaction with him was via email or telephone.

        (U//FOUO) BRYAN PAGLIANO was part of CLINTON's 2008 Presidential Campaign and was
later employed by DoS in a technical capacity. HANLEY would contact PAGLIANO for help with
physical Blackberry problems.

       (U//FOUO) HANLEY did not recall ever participating in, or overhearing, any discussion over
records retention issues, nor the legality of CLINTON conducting DoS business off a private server or
email account,

        (U//FOUO) HANLEY was asked to review a few emails forwarded from CLINTON at
hrod 17@c3intonemaii.com to HANLEY's DoS email account wherein CLINTON asks HANLEY to print
the forwarded email. After reviewing the email, HANLEY explained CLINTON did not like reading
things on her Blackberry because it was difficult to read the small font, so she preferred a hard copy for
longer emails. Sometimes CLINTON would keep the hard copy to archive the document, but HANLEY
was not privy to what documents CLINTON had printed for an easier read versus archiving.

______ (U//FOUO) HANLEY used two email accounts while at DoS: hartleynuffihtate a o v and
               [fiHtmail.com. HANLEY did not have an @clintonemail.com email account, nor was she             b6
ever offered an @cli ntonemail.com account. As a way of general practice, HANLEY tried her best to use        b7C
her state.gov email account for work related matters and her Gmail account for personal interactions with
CLINTON. HANLEY further explained she considered personal interactions with CLINTON to include
things like scheduling hair appointments. However, HANLEY noted that her state.gov email account was
not as easily accessible as her Gmail account and on some occasions she use Gmail when she could not
access her state.gov account.

       (U//TOUO) HANLEY was issued and carried/used a DoS Blackberry. It was difficult to access
DoS email while on travel, as the DoS system required users to sign in using a token/key to sign in
remotely. It was particularly difficult to sign into the DoS system in the Secretary's plane because the
wifi was not always compatible, so HANLEY would often use her Gmail account while in the air. The
same was true for foreign travel. Many DoS employees used personal email accounts because they were
more easily accessible. ABED IN emailed HANLEY equally from her state.gov and personal accounts.

Mobile Devices

        (U//F 0U 0) After she reviewed pictures of various Blackberry models, HANLEY pointed to the
picture of the Curve 8310 explained CLINTON preferred the Curve 8310 because she found the 8310
“track-ball” feature easier than the “track-pad” on newer Blackberry models. CLINTON tried the
Blackberry 8700G, but did not like the device because of the “track-pad.” HANLEY also thought the
Curve 8900 looked familiar. HANLEY did not recall the specific Blackberry devices CLINTON used at
DoS, but believed CLINTON's original Blackberry was black in color and housed in a blue silicone case.

        (U//FOUO) HANLEY recalled helping CLINTON change her Blackberry device at least three or
four times while she was at DoS. HANLEY recalled having to replace CLINTON's Blackberry on one
occasion after CLINTON spilled coffee on the device. Another time HANLEY recalled having to replace
CLINTON's Blackberry because it started to slowly fail overtime. HANLEY recalled proactively trying
to purchase replacement Blackberrys for CLINTON at one point, but CLINTON only liked the older
models. HANLEY believed she may have even purchased one of the older Blackberry models CLINTON
liked off of Ebay.

        (U//EQUQ) HANLEY would contact COOPER after purchasing a new Blackberry device for
CLINTON, and he would instruct HANLEY as to how to connect the device and sync the device with
CLINTON's server and email. Once the new device was properly synced, COOPER would also talk
HANLEY through the process of wiping the old device. HANLEY would provide the new Blackberry to
CLINTON along with the old/wiped Blackberry, However, HANLEY was not sure what CLINTON did
with the old Blackberry after HANLEY turned them over.

        (U//FOUO) Aside from receiving emails on her Blackberry, CLINTON used her Blackberry to
text and pin short personal messages.

        (U//FOUO) CLINTON also used an iPad. HANLEY could not recall when CLINTON obtained
the iPad, but thought it may have been purchased by COOPER. HANLEY was not sure who configured
CLINTON's iPad. CLINTON predominately used the iPad in the evenings and while on travel (both
domestic and international) for reading news articles and emails. CLINTON did use the iPad to send and
receive emails. CLINTON did not use the iPad while she was in her office at DoS.
                                                                                                              b6
        (U/ffOUe ) ABEDIN, HANLEY, and               had access to CLINTON1s iPad on occasion to
                                                                                                              b 7C
assist CLINTON if her iPad was not working properly, but HANLEY could not recall CLINTON giving
her iPad to anybody else to use.

        (U//TOUO) CLINTON received a new iPad in 2011 and gave HANLEY an iPad around the same
time. HANLEY assumed CLINTON gifted her with CLINTON's old iPad. Agents asked HANLEY to
review an email exchange dated 8/18/2011 between ABEDIN and COOPER in which ABEDIN tells
COOPER “She [presumably CLINTON] doesn't like ipad 2...” and later typed “She gave to monica as a
birthday gift.” After reviewing the email, HANLEY explained that she assumed she received CLINTON1s
old iPad, but now realizes she likely received CLINTON's newer iPad. HANLEY was not aware the iPad
was a birthday gift, but stated that it was not uncommon for CLINTON to gift ABEDIN and HANLEY
with some of her personal items she no longer wanted.

        (U//FOUO) When HANLEY received the iPad the opening screen said “H's iPad,” so before
using the gifted iPad, HANLEY wiped the device. HANLEY used the iPad for personal use up until the
time she moved back to New York in 2014. Prior to moving, HANLEY gave the iPad to                             b6
                                                                                                              b 7C

                              so he could use t re iPad to listen to music and podcasts. HANLEY did not
 wipe the iPad prior to gifting it to

         (U//FOUS ) In October of 2013, HANLEY received a call from CHERYL MILLS who inquired
 about the iPad. HANLEY explained she received what she believed was CLINTON's old iPad as a gift
 from CLINTON in 2011. MILLS subsequently informed HANLEY she needed to turn over the iPad in
 response to the FBI's investigation. HANLEY contacted           to retrieve the iPad and turned it over.

 Laptop Computer

         (U//FOUO) After they learned longtime friend of CLINTON, SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL, was the
 target of an email hack in Spring of 2013, PRN spoke with COOPER, ABEDIN, and HANLEY, and
 advised CLINTON change email addresses. CLINTON did not want to lose her old emails when she
 changed her email address. COOPER subsequently provided HANLEY an extra Apple Macbook from
 President Clinton's Harlem, NY, Office. HANLEY then transferred all of CLINTON's old emails from
 the PRN server to the Macbook Air. HANLEY transferred the emails to the Macbook in her________
I | apartment, and noted that it took several days because she transferred four years of emails.
 HANLEY also recalled transferring the emails to a thumb-drive, but could not recall what happened to the
 thumb-drive.

       (U//FOUO) HANLEY maintained possession of the Macbook following the transfer of the emails.
The Macbook was stored in HANLEY's apartment. HANLEY moved at least once after she transferred
the emails to the Macbook, and brought the Macbook with her to her new apartment.

         fUZ/FOtJO) HANLEY continued to work for CL NTON following DoS, and in early 2014 took a
 position in the                                        Shortly thereafter, HANLEY realized she still
 had possession of the Macbook containing CLINTON's archived emails. HANLEY subsequently
 contacted PRN on her own accord and spoke with                        an><£
 HANELY shipped the Macbook to                  in              in February and instructed PRN to
 migrate the emails back to CLINTON's existing server, wipe the Macbook, and return the Macbook to
                            who was CLINTON's                     at the time.

           (U//FOUO) The Macbook was shopped fromf



        (U//FOUQ) When HANLEY was first contacted by FBI agents in November 2015 in regards
 scheduling an interview, she reached out tcj_             to ask about the whereabouts of the Macbook.
                 told HANLEY she did not recall receiving the Macbook from PRN.

Handling of Classified Material

       (U//FOUO) CLINTON did not have a classified DoS account, and received all classified
information in paper form. CLINTON's Executive Assistant, JOE McMANUS, was responsible for
determining what classified information needed to be passed up to CLINTON. The Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) Presidential Daily Briefer (PDB) on occasion may have also flagged information for
CLINTON to read. When CLINTON was on travel, her traveling Executive Assistant or SULLIVAN
would determine what classified information needed CLINTON's attention.

        (U//FOUO) HANLEY visited both CLINTON's Chappaqua, NY, and Washington, DC,                             b6
residences, however, HANLEY spent more time in CLINTON's Washington, DC, home. HANLEY                          b7C
believed CLINTON had a Sensitive Information Compartmented Facility (SCIF) installed on I
floor of her Chappaqua home that contained at least a secure phone and fax. CLINTON also had a SCIF
in her DC home. HANLEY believed the DC SCIF contained a secure phone and unclassified Mac
desktop, but was not sure about a fax machine.

        (U//FQDQ) When the DoS Operations Center needed to get classified material to CLINTON at
                                                                                                               b6
her DC residence, the information would be couriered by her security detail in a diplomatic pouch. Only        b7C
a few people close to CLINTON, such as HANLEY could deliver the diplomatic pouch directly to her.
HANLEY assumed CLINTON's _                     in Chappaqua,                        could also accept and
deliver diplomatic pouches.

        (U//FOUO) A DoS Mobile Communications Team (MCT) traveled with CLINTON on both
international and domestic trips. The MCT was responsible for setting up a command post for   t>l p e r        DOS
CLINTON's team, Depending on the security climate at the destination, the mobile command post would

                     by CLINTON or her designated staff t he MCT generally set up an unclassified
DoS computer in either ABEDIN or HANLEY's room for the purpose of printing unclassified
information for CLINTON. It was not uncommon for HANLEY to use her personal Gmail account to
print from the mobile DoS unclassified terminal because even though she was using a DoS computer, the
DoS connection was unreliable.

       (U//F0U6 ) CLINTON had a secure phone in her office at DoS, as well as in both her
Washington, DC, and Chappaqua, NY, residences. When CLINTON was traveling, ABEDIN would
generally carry a secure cell phone. HANLEY carried the secure phone on occasion, and described the
phone as looking like an old Nokia non-flip phone with a big antenna and large buttons. The secure cell
phone was carried in a box. ABEDIN kept a secure cell phone in her desk at DoS.

         (U//FOUQ) HANLEY received a lesson from somebody on the DoS technical team in regards to
using the secure cell phone, but when HANLEY tried to use the secure cell phone in 2012 on a trip to
Haiti, it did not work.

Email Review

        (U//FOUO) HANLEY was contacted by CLINTON's attorney, DAVID KENDALL (Williams &
Connolly), in March or April of 2015. Following her conversation with KENDALL, HANLEY searched
the Gmail account she used while at DoS for any email communications with state.gov accounts and
deleted emails associated with state.gov accounts. HANLEY was not involved with any efforts to review
and cull CLINTON'S emails.

General Security Matters

       (U//FOUQ) HANLEY never personally was notified of an intrusion attempt against any of her
email accounts (personal or Gmail), however, she remembered hearing some state email accounts were
hacked by presumably the Chinese Government following one of CLINTON’s trips to China.

        (U//FOUO) HANLEY also received verbal security counseling from Diplomatic Security (DS)
following a Russia trip on which she accompanied CLINTON. HANLEY was handed a diplomatic pouch
containing CLINTON's briefing book on the plane upon arriving in Russia. HANLEY brought the pouch
and its contents into the Russian hotel suite she shared with CLINTON. DS found a classified document
from the briefing book in the suite during a sweep following CLINTON and HANLEY's departure, and

and filtering information intended for CLINTON,             reviewed various reports and
information/action memos to determine which warranted forwarding to CLINTON, and would
subsequently filter out and clean up the most relevant information to forward to CLINTON via her
Executive Secretary, JOSEPH MACMANUS. The reports                   reviewed were a '‘mixed bag,’ and
included everything from unclassified ceremony notifications and Talking Points, to Secret and Top
Secret intelligence briefings.

forwarded in regards to their classification.

stated he was familiar with the email and was aware that it was recently released as part of a recent
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request concerning CLINTON'S emails.

        (U//FOUO) The email in question originated as an unclassified email from the DoS Operations
Center to[_______who stripped the preceding trail of emails and possibly fixed a few g ammafi^al and               be

he likely also added “(Important)” in the Subject line of the email, but did not make any substantive
changes to the email before forwarding it. The email would have initially come td              ~lfrom a specific
person in the Operations Center However]               |did not recall who specifically in the Operations
Center sent that particular email IIdid not have a record of the email he received from the
Operations Center, but stated that the Operations Center does maintain all records. MCMANUS and/or
                     would be individuals with access to the Operations Center records.

However, he would orally brief information more often than email.______ pould not recall an instance
where he was concerned with the Operations Center moving classified information from the high side to
the low side.

       (U//FQUO) The majority of the personnel in the Operations Center are Civil Service employees
who receive extensive structured training before they are on their own on the “Ops Floor.” The
Operations Center receives information from all over the Intelligence Community (IC). One person on
each watch shift is tasked with the “watch fax,” which receives reports from all over the IC.

        (U//FOUO) ______further stated that he thought the “discussion over (the aforementioned) email             be

from the IC.

2015. Initially, IPS officials were told there were 14 bankers boxes of former Secretary of State Hillary
CLINTON’s emails at CLINTON's Friendship Heights office. Later, officials were told that the boxes
would be picked up from Williams & Connolly, LLP. On or about December 5, 201^ IPS nersonnel
picked up only 12 bankers boxes of CLINTON's emails from Williams & Connolly.                      and
other IPS officials were not sure if the boxes were consolidated or what could have happened to t he two
other boxes. The boxes were labeledjadlh_daie_ranges, which were accurate for the most part. Some of the
documents were filed out of order.               opined the documents were pre-arranged differently than
one would expect if the documents were simply printed out and then stacked into the boxes. IPS
personnel provided copies of the documents to STATE's Bureau of Legislative Affairs, Office of the
Legal Adviser, and the Office of Congressional and Public Affairs.

         Although, CLINTON was sworn in as Secretary of State in January 2009, IPS officials were
unable to Locate any nf her emails from January-April 2009 in the documents provided by Williams &
Connolly. |__________ did not know whether CLINTON used a different email address at that time.
A preliminary review of the documents did not occur until months later. IPS had to wait on the Office of
Legal Counsel to provide an official determination as to whether the emails would be considered official
STATE records. At some point, the determination was made that the emails would not be considered
official STATE records.

             and his team were told to do a “light review with light redactions.” but were later told by the
Office of Legal Counsel to perform a regular FOIA review,                    special team of senior
reviewers, approximately 40 full-time equivalent reviewers, worked with t re appropriate Bureaus on
possible classified information and sent the proper referrals to the United States Intelligence Community
(USIC) partners.
                                                                                                               b6
                      did not think                  and the Office of Legislative Affairs attorneys had the   b7C
appropriate training and experience to review, redact and produce emails responsive to Congressional
inquiries and especially not expert enough to respond to FOIA requests. For starters             ind her
team performed their entire review, redacted what they did, and then copied the 296 emails to a .pdf file
on an unclassified network. If any information was later found to be classified, then they would have not
only corrupted every computer that touched that classified information, but they might have contributed to
a loss of classified data. IPS always pushed their material to the SIPR.NET network and used their “F2”
enclave to perform their FOIA review before disseminating their products. Also, the 296 emails provided
by            via .pdf included redactions done for CLINTON's privacy but unrelated to national security.
                                                                                                               b6
                      believed there was interference with the formal FOIA review process. Specifically,       b7C
STA' E's Near East Affjaiis-Bmeau upgraded several of C UNTON's emails to a classified level with a
B(1) release exemption,       ____ ilong with                attorney. Office of Legal Counsel called
STATE1s Near East Affairs Bureau and told inem tney could use a B(5) exemption on an upgraded email
to protect it instead of the B( I) exemption. However, the use of the B(5) exemption, which is usually
used for executive privilege-related information, was incorrect as the information actually was classified
and related to national security, which would be a B(l) exemption.
                                                                                                               b6

to             and were not the, normal points of contact that IPS used for other agencies. More
importantly, although           and          Jthought their quick initial review showed none of the 296        b6

of the loop for the materials initially sent to Congress and had no idea what kind of review             and
her team performed.              and            seemed to have been placed in their specific positions by top
STATE officials; they appeared to have a very narrow focus on all CL INTON-related items, and were put
in positions that were not advertised.

        In early May 2015, KENNEDY called an interagency meeting regarding the scheduled release of
all the CLINTON-related emails by the January 15. 2016 deadline and asked for quick turnarounds on any
future requests. People in attendance include^            representatives from White House Counsel,             b6

National Security Council (NSC).

        Immediately following that meeting. KENNEDY held a closed-door meeting with                             b7C
           m                               DOJ's Office of Information Programs where KENNEDY

            kef           to change the FBI1s classification determination regarding one of CLINTON's
            :h tn
emails, which  the FBI considered classified. The email was related to FBI counter-terrorism operations.
                                                                                                                b6
        i^ENNEDY called                 directly on one occasion. The purpose of that call was to ask           b7C
            questions regarding pressure from the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence
Community (ICIG) to complete the review of the approximately 30,000 emails. Specifically, KENNEDY
wanted to know if there was precedent to have outside reviewers help STATE with the FOIA process. At
that time              was unaware of STA' E IG 1s and ICIG1s June 19, 2015 joint recommendation to
STATE regarding the FOIA review process                            ICIG, offered [              and IPS extra
reviewers from the intelligence community to help review the 30,000 emails. However, many of those
reviewing officials arrived untrained to formally review items. After the initial training, those reviewers
became instrumental to the review process.
                                                                                                                b6
       __________|had not felt as much pressure regarding the review and release of the 30,000 emails as        b7C
with the 296 Benghazi-related emails. I

______________________ Insteadof pressure, it felt more like curiosity as to the raw numbers of emails
already reviewed, upgraded from unclassified to classified, referred to outside agencies, and/or released
publicly. To date, approximately 1,600 referrals were made to USIC partners. Many of those emails
discussed foreign governments and their leaders along with various sensitive telephone calls. Other
emails existed that would later be referred to the USIC. Those emails included emails from STATE
personnel discussing information lost as a result of the “Wikileaks” scandal.

        Some material from the 30,000 emails, though unmarked as such, were definitely classified back
in 2009-2012 and still remained classified. On the other hand, it was true some material (in general, not
specific to the 30,000 emails) could have been previously classified, but were later downgraded. An

example would be CLINTON1s travel schedule or security-related information based on specific times
and places. It was a very large security concern for IPS when they heard some STATE employees
assumed all documents on unclassified system were unclassified, based on being on an unclassified
system and having no portion markings.

         One email that was ungraded from the 30.000 emails was an email exchange between CLINTON
an{                     formerl                           [vhprp hnth individuals used their personal email   b6

addresses to discuss matters related to Russia. Despite this,          responded to KENNEDY’s request
for all STATE-related personal emails with a letter that statec          had no STATE-related emails in
his personal email account.

        STATE was normally able to complete classification upgrades very quickly, The upgrade would
happen after STATE bureaus and other agencies determined, 1) how the information was obtained; (2)
what the information was; (3) based on current global events/situations; or (4) because the information
was, initially, improperly marked as unclassified.
                                                                                                              b6
                    heard the argument that some of CLINTON's emails were unclassified back in the            b7C
2009-2012 timeframe when they were initiated, but were later classified due to various circumstances. It
was very rare for something that was actually unclassified to become classified years after the fact.
                                                         National Archives would be a good point of
contact for knowledge on the upgrading process in general.
                                                                                                              b6
               about August 10, 2015,             from Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) called        b7C
              and told her CENTCOM records showed approximately 1,000 work-related emails between
CLINTON'S personal email and General David PETRAEUS, former Commander of CENTCOM and
former Director of the CIA. Most of those 1,000 emails were not believed to be included in the 30,000
emails that IPS was reviewing. Out of the 30,000 emails, IPS only had a few emails from or related to
PETRAEUS, as well as a few related to Leon PANETTA, former Secretary of Defense. There were a lot
of emails to/from Denis MCDONOUGH, former Deputy National Security Advisor and current White
House Chief of Staff.
                                                                                                              b6
                    described Jacob SULLIVAN and Cheryl MILLS as “gatekeepers” for sending                    b7C
CLINTON emails/material; they would filter or reyiew most items that CLINTON would receive.
           recommended the FBI talk to his boss               specifically about individuals at STATE
who hold~a~weekly meeting about Congressional records production and the FOIA process as well as
wherel ---- [felt pressure came from regarding upgrading any of the 296 Benghazi-related emails.

interview, were                    landf                After being advised of the identities of the
interviewing agents, and the purpose of the interview, HANLEY provided the following information:

        (U//FOUO) HANLEY created an archive of HILLARY R. CLINTON1s hdr22@:c1 intoneniail.com
emails in March 2013 as a result of concerns related to a reported hack of SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL's
email account. HANLEY recalled participating in a conference call with HUMA ABEDIN and JUSTIN
COOPER following the hack to discuss changing CLINTON's email address.                           may
have also participated in the call. While the group ultimately decided together to change CLINTON's
account, ABEDIN selected the new name of the email account, hrodl 7@c-1in ton email com.

        (U//rOUQ) COOPER set up the email account and assisted HANLEY with the technical details
concerning creating a backup of hdr2 2@.c1into nem ai 1.corn. COOPER provided HANLEY an Apple Mac
laptop from the Clinton Foundation, which HANLEY took home to her apartment ini                      1
HANLEY remotely signed on to CLINTON's email server from her apartment, as COOPER
telephonically walked her through the steps to transfer the emails from the server to the laptop and a
thumb drive. HANLEY used MacMail, a built in application on the laptop, to transfer the emails.
HANLEY initiated the process, and left the computer running, as the entire transfer process took a few
days.

       (U//TOUO) CLINTON's email address was changed from hdr22@cllntoneniaii.com to
hrod 17@cllntoneniail.com before the archive was created.

        (U//FOUO) While HANLEY could not recall the specific model of the aforementioned Apple
laptop provided by COOPER, she did recall the model was not an “Air,” but was likely a “Pro” because it
had an ethernet port and a thumb drive portal. HANLEY further provided that the laptop she received
from COOPER was silver in color and seemed like a newer model. The thumb drive HANLEY used was
something she happened to have laying around the house. She could not recall any details concerning the
brand or appearance of the thumb drive.

transitioned to a job in the______________________in early 2014. HANLEY thought the laptop was
stored in a drawer or on the desk in her bedroom. HANLEY did not use the laptop after the transfer of
emails, nor did she have knowledge of anybody else accessing the laptop. The laptop was also password
protected, so it would be impossible for anybody to access the laptop without HANLEY's assistance.

        (U//F 0U 0) HANLEY could not recall whatever came of the thumb drive she created, and
searched her apartment multiple times in attempts to locate it. HANLEY thought she might have given
the thumb drive to ABED IN when she transitioned to ________________ as she provided ABEDIN with                   be
                                                                                                                   b7C
several items upon departure. However, HANLEY did not specifically recall providing ABEDIN with
said thumb drive.

        (U//TOUO) After the emails were transferred from hdr22@ciimo.nemali com to the laptop and
thumb drive, the intention was to delete the emails off the CLINTON email server. HANLEY would not
have been involved with deleting emails, and assessed COOPER would have been responsible for
deleting anything directly from the server.

         (U//FOUO) In 2014, after she was no longer working for CLINTON, HANLEY realized she still
had possession of the Macbook containing CLINTON's archived emails. HANLEY subsequently
contacted Platte River Networks (PRN) on her own accord and spoke with                                  |          be
                                                                                                                   b7C
HANLEY initially tried to remotely send                       the archive via the following application, which
                provided HANLEY via email:
https://broker. gotoassi st.com/li/citrixassi st?Questi on:::DR031 -43 8-732. HANLEY initially attempted to
transfer the archive to                  ]remotely from CLINTON's New York residence via the
aforementioned website, however it did not work. HANLEY subsequently attempted to send the archive
remotely from her own residence, and was also unsuccessful. HANLEY and                            ^ultimately
decided HANLEY would ship the laptop containing the archive to                          and he would transfer
the archive to CLINTON's PRN server. [                       lwas then going to wipe the laptop and return it to
                             who was CLINTON's                          at the time. HANLEY shipped the
laptop to                  as they discussed, but was not aware of what happened to the laptop thereafter.

       (U//FOHQ) CLINTON did not know her email login information, as HANLEY would generally
change the information in CLINTON's BlackBerry when necessary so CLINTON's email would
automatically populate. When CLINTON's password required changing, HANLEY would choose a new
password, update CLINTON'S BlackBerry with the change, and notify ABEDIN, COOPER and BRYAN
PAGLIANO. HANLEY had CLINTON's email logon information and password, so she could check
CLINTON's email if needed. On occasion, CLINTON would ask HANLEY to research an old email that
CLINTON was unable to pull up on her BlackBerry, In order to respond said request, HANLEY would

open up CLINTON's email account remotely from a computer and print the document for CLINTON.
HANLEY assumed ABEDIN also accessed CLINTON'S email account on occasion,

        (U//FOUO) HANLEY often purchased replacement BlackBerry devices for CLINTON when she
was Secretary of State. CLINTON preferred BlackBerry devices that contained a roller-ball rather than
the more modern touch pad. HANLEY recalled purchasing most of CLINTON's replacement BlackBerry
devices from a Washington, DC, AT&T Store in DuPont Circle. HANLEY also recalled purchasing one
BlackBerry from an AT&T store in the Pentagon City Mall in Arlington, VA. HANLEY also recalled
purchasing a replacement BlackBerry for CLINTON from either Ebay or Amazon, but stated this took
place after CLINTON's tenure at the Department of State.

       (U//FQUO) HANLEY had little insight into the writing process of CLINTON's book/memoir.
She recalled CLINTON meeting with the writers regularly for multi hour meetings, where she assumed
CLINTON would share topics and anecdotes she wanted to cover in the book. HANLEY also printed out
chapters of the memoir as it was being written so CLINTON could make edits. HANLEY had no
knowledge of the writers having access to CLINTON's emails.

       (LV/f^DUO) At the conclusion of the interview. HANLEY agreed to provide interviewing agents
                                                                                                             b6

  entail accounts. Upon leaving DOS, SULLIVAN boxed up his official DOS paper records and turned
  them over to the DOS. SULLIVAN recalled the DOS handled the preservation of his email records horn
  DOS servers. SULLIVAN recalled one brief conversation in the summer of 2014 with MILLS and

 with handling d assailed information in general SULLIVAN slated CUNION never expressed fs concern
about the handling of classified information. While at tltc DOS, SULLIVA'N felt his coiicagtics
judgement was good and that they had a good understanding of how to handle classified information,
iieneraiiy, while at the DOS. SULLIVAN stated lie had to pay attention to what information goes on what
channel For instance, he would convey what he could on an unclassified system and then go to
equipment authorized to handle classified communications to convey more information.

       it DH'.Mh7) After reviewing an email dated October -L 2000. with subject line "FW: Cover
memo." SUL Li VAN’s attorney. BETH WILKINSON, asked for the classification of the email. After
being advised the email was pending classification review and to treat the email as classified.
WILKINSON stated her client would not answer questions related to the foregoing email, or any
documents related to the entail

        lLwT*OUO) SULLIVAN stated SYONLY BLUMfiNTHAL was someone CUN'ION knew from
years hack and was someone who "liked to help the cause.’*As SULLIVAN understood it.
BLUMENTHAL hud a variety of sources of information, SULLIVAN was unaware of the identities of
the sources used by BLUMENTHAL. SULLIVAN recalled BLUMENTHAL would sometimes refer to
information he gathered from former intelligence officers, but SULLIVAN understood those people to be
red red with no access to eius.siikd information. SULLIVAN would occasionally talk to BLUMliNTHAL
through phone conversations and maybe through email. In those conversations. BLUMENTHAL would
relay information about "big picture” topics BLUMENTHAL thought were relevant and SULLIVAN
would pass it on to CLINTON or DOS stakeholders to have them validate the information. SULLIVAN
never heard of a concern that BLUMENTHAL had access to, or was relaying, classified information.

                       (U//FOUO) PATRICK FRANCIS KENNEDY, Under Secretary of State for Management, was
               interviewed at his office at Department of State (DoS), Harry S. Truman Building, 2201 C Street NW
               Washington. D.C.. by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agents (SA)________________ and
                               | Also present for the interview was FBI National Security Law Branch (NSLB) Attorney
                             and Senior ~
                                        DoS Counsel'                After being advised of the identity of the interviewing
               agents, and the nature of the interview, KENNEDY provided the following information:

                      (U//F 0U 6) KENNEDY was aware Secretary of State HILLARY CLINTON used a personal
               email account during her tenure as Secretary, but was unaware that she was using a personal server.
               KENNEDY received an unclassified email from CLINTON approximately once a month and noted those
               emails came from a clintonemail.com address.

                      (U//FOUQ) The DoS “GO” system allows for DoS employees to remotely access their DoS
               account from a non-DoS server. DoS policy does not support the routine use of private email accounts for
               for DoS business. However it was understood that exceptions could be made in emergency situations, and
               in doing so, the employee should carbon copy their DoS email account for matters of record.

                      (U//FOUO) KENNEDY mostly received emails from CLINTON after hours, and so infrequently
               he was not aware of the volume of which she was using her personal account. KENNEDY was not aware
               CLINTON was solely using a personal email account for communicating unclassified DoS business.

                       (U//TOUO) DoS policy does not support the use of private email servers for continued personal
               use, nor the use of personal servers for DoS business, thus there is no approval process for their use. DoS
               policy remains the same for the use of both personal emails and servers today as it was during
               CLINTON'S tenure.

                       (U//F0U0) KENNEDY recalled news stories implying a former DoS employee, BRYAN
               PAGLIANO, set up CLINTON's private email and server “on the side” while working for DoS.
               However, KENNEDY noted he was not aware of PAGLIANO's involvement until it hit the press. DoS is
               refraining from direct inquiries into PAGLIANO's involvement until the FBI completes its investigation.

        (U//FOUO) KENNEDY had no direct knowledge of any of CLINTON's predecessors [COLIN
POWELL and CONDOLEEZZA RICE] using private email accounts, but noted he was aware POWELL
publically mentioned he used a private email account during his tenure as Secretary of State in his most
recent publication.

         (U//F 0 U 6 ) DoS has the responsibility of interfacing with foreign diplomats and political
representatives within the United States and overseas to help develop policy. Sometimes information
from these dignitaries is given in confidence and sometimes it is not. The classification of such
information is specific to the situation. KENNEDY explained that information given in confidence may
be initially transmitted as unclassified to report the information, but later “up-classified” when it is further
assessed the disclosure of such information might damage national security or diplomatic relationships.
Ultimately, the originator of a document or email is responsible for classifying the document.

        (U//FQD6 ) KENNEDY explained the Intelligence Community (IC) “steals” information, and thus
has to classify said information to protect sources and methods. DoS may get the same information
through diplomatic channels and not classify that information because it was not received from a sensitive
source or a method. According to KENNEDY, the classification of a DoS document depends on the
content of the message and if it is important for the other party not to disclose the information.

       (U//FOUO) If a DoS employee wanted to use classified information derived from IC sources in an
unclassified channel, they would need to submit a tearline request to do so. DoS cannot declassify a
document that was not originally classified by a DoS classification authority.

        (U//F0U6 ) The Secretary of State is a declassification authority, as are the Secretary's Chief of
Staff and Deputy Chief of Staff. KENNEDY believed CHERYL MILLS, JAKE SULLIVAN, and
possibly HUMA ABEDIN would have been classification authorities during CLINTON's tenure at DoS.

       (U//FOUO) KENNEDY acknowledged DoS received their first request to produce emails related
to CLINTON1s email sometime in 2014. The request was related to a Congressional inquiry concerning
documents related to the 2012 attack of the United States consulate in Benghazi. The initial request was
focused on specific emails, but was later expanded to include a broader production.

       (U//FOUO) KENNEDY was not part of the initial dialogue with CLINTON concerning the
aforementioned request for emails. KENNEDY was only involved with interacting with Congress
concerning the status of the request, but was not involved in the process of deciding what was and was not
released in response. The DoS Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) team directly handled the request by
reaching out to the appropriate Bureau or Secretariat who maintained the information concerning
Benghazi. The Bureau of Near East Affairs would have been contacted by FOIA in regards to general
Benghazi information.                                                                            The DoS           b6
                                                                                                                   b7C

FOIA team would have reached out to the records staff in the Executive Secretariat for specific
CLINTON communications concerning Benghazi.

       (tJ//FQEK3t DoS FOIA inquiries are handled bv the Bureau of Administration/ Global Information
Services,_____________________________________________________ The DoS Bureau involves a
team of supervisors, processors and reviewers, almost all of which are retired foreign or civil service. The
supervisors assign the requests to processors who load the information into their FOIA management
system and send out requests to all the Bureaus who have a relevant relation to the request. The review bb7C 6

team collects the information received from the relevant Bureaus and determines what if any exemptions
should be considered and/or applied. The FOIA review team also determines if the information
responsive to the request contains any outside agency equities, and appropriately coordinates with those
agencies to respond to the request. Furthermore, the FOIA response goes through a review and
reconciliation process to ensure all responsive documents are marked and redacted appropriately.
                                            in regards to the DoS FOIA process. However, there is an
appeals process which involves a FOIA review board managed out of the DoS Information Oversight
Office

         (U//F 6 U 0 ) Responsive documents to FOIA requests are also placed on the DoS FOIA website in
their releasable form to avoid redundant FOIA requests from other parties.

        (U//FOUO) KENNEDY recalled discussions concerning CLINTON wanting to cull her emails
prior to producing emails related to the Congressional/FOIA requests. The purpose of the cull was to
remove emails related to personal communications between CLINTON and her family that were not
relevant to DoS matters. DoS was not involved in the cull, as it is the responsibility of the individual to
produce records of relevance for the record. KENNEDY did not recall who was involved in assisting
CLINTON cull her emails.

        (U//FOUO) DoS employees identify their own files for the record and can generally archive them
in the State Messaging and Archival Retrieval Toolset (SMART) system, which allows for electronic
marking/tagging of emails for the record. However, SMART is not used by the Executive Secretariat,
thus CLINTON would have likely had to use a print and file system, or simply keep all of her emails for
the record. As a matter of personal preference, KENNEDY retains all of his electronic DoS
communications in an active file.

        (U//FOUO) When asked in retrospect if he had concerns over how DoS conducted its response to
the FOIA request regarding CLINTON's emails, KENNEDY responded “yes and no.” KENNEDY did
not elaborate. KENNEDY further explained he contacted the FBI Deputy Director and requested an
electronic copy of all the CLINTON emails turned over to the FBI in regards to the FBI's investigation,
so DoS could make a better assessment in regards to evaluating their role/response.

        (U//F8 U 0) KENNEDY “categorically rejected” allegations he attempted influence FOIA
markings to protect and/or mask classified information. KENNEDY__________________________                   b6
                                                                                                            b7C
and described her as someone who “says it like it is” and has “no fear of telling truth to power.”
KENNEDY further explained he has full confidence!                 Iwould not allow undue influence to
effect her ability to properly carry out the FOIA process in accordance with the Presidents mandate to
both air on the side of transparency and national security.

        (U//FOUO) KENNEDY was one of three people he was aware of at DoS who have the authority
                                                                                                            b6

classification upgrade would be warranted in a situation where the change in a government may change
relationships, and information that would not have endangered the United States or sources before said
government change would then be considered a threat to national security or to the sources safety.

        (U//FOUO) KENNEDY stated he was available for re-contact should interviewing agents have
additional questions to ask at a later date.

CLINTON's time in office. Part of                     job was to maintain and support the infrastructure for
the UNCLASSIFIED and SECRET networks for the Executive Secretariat. Every Department of State,
hereafter State, Secretary____________has interacted with, except for Secretary JOHN KERRY, has used
personal email during his or her time in office. For example. Secretary COLIN POWELL used America
Online. Secretary Clinton, however, was the first Secretary to use a privately maintained email server,
hereafter Server. |             |did not agree with the decision, but it made sense to him because
Secretary CLINTON had used the Server for the previous two years. Secretary CLINTON did not have a
desktop computer in her office to access email while at State, but did have non-SCIF space near her office
where she could use her BlackBerry,                   believed Secretary CLINTON received an
operational security briefing that involved the National Security Agency after being sworn in as Secretary
of State.I              "Ifrom the Bureau Security Office would have coordinated the briefing.

him to keep it communicating with State systems. For example, there were approximately 5-6 instances
where emails sent by Secretary CLINTON to State employees, or vice-versa, were not received by the end
user. In these instances,              |and PAGLIANO worked together to modify settings so the emails
would make it through. Additionally, the two worked to establish transport layer security (TLS) between
State systems and the Server as a security measure.

        (U//FOUO) Since PAGLIANO was an IRM Schedule C employee of State                             invited
him to various briefings regarding security and system vulnerabilities. PAGLIANO's job at State was
policy development relai ed to mobile computing, so these briefings were also relevant to his role in that
capacity,                specifically recalled discussions about Bluetooth vulnerabilities and blue jacking.

interviewing Agents and the nature of the interview, LINICK provided the following information:

        On or about March 12, 2015, STATE IG received a letter from U S. Senators Bob Corker, Richard
Burr and Ron Johnson. The letter requested a review of State Department employees' usage of personal
email for official purposes and coordination with relevant agencies to determine whether classified
information was transmitted or received by State Department employees over personal systems. On April
 16, 2015, pursuant to this letter, STATE IG initiated a review of the use of personal communications
hardware and software by five Secretaries of State and their immediate staffs. The review covered current
Secretary of State John Kerry all the way back to former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. STATE
IG's review was further broken down into three categories 1) On-boarding Process (which looked into the
approval process for the use of personal networks), 2) Preservation of Records (how records were
maintained/preserved), and 3) the FOIA response.

        LINICK believed STATE IG's office was not qualified to determine whether classified
information was transmitted and referred that portion of the review to the Office of the Inspector General
of the Intelligence Community (ICIGV Separately. STATE IG had the Benghazi review and                   I
                                                                                                     I The
Department of State was also conducting a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) review of fifty five
thousand pages of emails belonging to Secretary Clinton pursuant to a court order. In December 2014, the
Department of State received hard copies of those documents from Secretary Clinton's Counsel.

        LINICK initially believed Department of State received electronic copies of Secretary Clinton's
email from her private server. During a July I, 2015 meeting with STATE IG. Patrick KENNEDY, Under
Secretary for Management, U.S. Department of State and___________________ advised STATE IG the
Department of State had obtained an electronic copy of Secretary Clinton's email. On July 10, 2015,
STATE IG requested two copies of the .PST files for use by STATE IG and ICIG. Later, KENNEDY

MILLS and ABEDIN.

         On May 26, 2015 ICIG and STATE IG sent a joint preservation letter to Williams & Connolly for
the @clinontonemail.com account records in their possession. Although, LINICK was generally aware of
the status of ICIG's ongoing review to identify classified information, which consisted of jointly working
with the Department of State FOIA staff, LINICK was not heav lv involved in that process. LINICK

Programs and Services and                 Office of Global Information Services. Both               and
         were involved in the FOIA review process and alleged there were potentially hundreds of
classified emails found during their review.              further alleged that twq______________
                    currently working at State Department were meddling with the FOIA review process.

      On or about June 19, 2015 STATE IG and ICIG jointly made four recommendations to the State
Department related to the FOIA review process. The recommendations were as follows:

    1. Recommend State Department FOIA office request staff support from IC FOIA offices to assist in
       the identification of intelligence community equities;
    2. Recommend IC FOIA officers review the emails to ensure that ClassNet use is appropriate before
       transmitting to the State Bureaus for review;
    3. Recommend State Department FOIA seek classification expertise from the interagency to act as a
       final arbiter if there is a question regarding potentially classified materials; and
    4. Recommend State Department FOIA Office incorporate the Department of Justice into the FOIA
       process to ensure the legal sufficiency review of the FOIA exemptions and redactions.

        Based on a later response from KENNEDY, the Department of State had accented
recommendations number one and three. LINICK suggested the FBI talk to ____                        and        b6

interaction with Secretary Clinton's counsel, Williams & Connolly. LINICK believed         had sent
emails back and forth with David KENDALL, Secretary Clinton1s attorney.

        LINICK surmised the Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual that was in use during
Secretary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State did not give clear and specific guidance regarding the use
of private email, although it was highly discouraged. If employees used private email to conduct official
State Department business, that email had to be forwarded to an @state.gov email within twenty days
after being sent. The Department of State had no process for approving the use of private networks. There
were no rules in place that specifically denied Secretary Clinton the use of her private network.

        LINICK did not believe he was qualified to explain the Department of State's retroactive
classif cation process. LINICK did not know whether the Department of State had provided a safe to
Williams & Connolly, nor did LINICK know if the Department of State had the authority to certify a non­
government facility as secure storage for classified information.

        LINICK advised Secretary Clinton had brought Bryan PAGLIANO into the Department of State
to set up her private network. PAGLIANO was still a Department of State employee who worked in the
Department of State's information technology department, However, PAGLIANO refused to be
interviewed by STATE IG. PAGLIANO informed STATE IG he was represented by counsel from Akin
Gump Straus Hauer & Feld, LLP. LINICK recommended the FBI interview PAGLIANO.

        LINICK did not intend on directly contacting Secretary Clinton to request electronic copies of her
private network email. Since there was a spillage of classified information, for which STATE IG is not
equipped to handle, the referral was made to the FBI.

search ;he foregoing BlackBerry files and to gain consent to search,                                     b7C
        believed the FBI would need to consult HILLARY CLINTON's
lawyers at WILLIAMS AND CONNOLLY.

          COOPER stated he worked for former President BILL CLINTON
for approximately 16 years as an aide serving many capacities. In
2007, COOPER and other aides debated using a private server for the
sole purpose of email exchange and as a result, a contract with Apple
was signed for the set-up and administration of an OS X server
(hereafter, Apple server). The foregoing Apple server was installed at
the CLINTON residence located in Chappaqua, New York and was online in
and around June 2008 and configured for a handful of users. COOPER
recalled                                                                                                 b6

accounts using the domain presidentclinton.com. The domain
wjcoffice.com was another domain used for BILL CLINTON related staff
and email, but COOPER referred to it as a legacy domain that had
mostly forwarded email. BILL CLINTON did not have an email account on
the Apple server and did not use email as far as COOPER understood. In
January 2009, HILLARY CLINTON was looking to move away from a
BlackBerry with AT&T service, and decided to register the domain
clintonemail.com and host it on the Apple server. COOPER had no
specific memory, but believed he could have been the individual to
register the domain because he handled financial issues for the
CLINTONS. In or around January 2009, the users determined the Apple
server was not robust enough and based this assessment on unreliable
BlackBerry connectivity. At that time, the Apple server was not run in
conjunction with a BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES).

          In or around March 2009, BRYAN PAGLIANO, an Information
Technology (IT) professional used by HILLARY CLINTON, took full
control of setting up a Windows Small Business Server (hereafter,
Windows server) as well as a BES, at the CLINTON residence in
Chappaqua, New York. PAGLIANO built the server from equipment used in
HILLARY CLINTON’S campaign for the democratic nomination to run for
President of the United States. COOPER did not know where PAGLIANO
built the server, but knew it was in place and running at the
Chappaqua residence in or around March 2009. COOPER was aware that

PAGLIANO set-up firewalls, spam filters and possibly Cisco Adaptive
Security Appliance (ASA) software, but only PAGLIANO would know the
configuration of the set-up. PAGLIANO managed the porting of users
from the Apple server to the Windows server, as well as handled all
software upgrades and general maintenance. COOPER believed there was a
back-up drive as part of the Windows server and wasn't aware of any
additional back-ups, although he recalled many boxes around the
Windows server and reiterated PAGLIANO would know the exact
configuration. Concerning the various avenues of connectivity to the
server for user devices, COOPER referred Agents to PAGLIANO.
Cablevision provided internet service to the CLINTON residence in
Chappaqua, and that internet service was used to connect the Windows
server. COOPER believed no outside spam service provider was retained
for the Windows server. COOPER believed in instances where the Windows
server went down, like in the event of a power outage, emails were re­
directed to a gmail account as a back-up. COOPER was aware of two (2)
power outages, based on storms or natural disasters, occurring during
the lifecycle of the Windows server, but was not aware of any specific
users or corresponding gmail accounts that had email forwarded.

          COOPER was granted administrator rights, along with
PAGLIANO, to the Windows server and described his role as the customer
service face. As part of this role, COOPER could add a user or reset a
password. COOPER also continued in his role of acquisition or
purchasing for the CLINTONS, and this extended to server related
items. For instance, COOPER recalled using both Network Solutions and
GoDaddy to register domains, but would only have used these companies
because he was directed to, either by Apple or PAGLIANO. COOPER read
in the press about the Windows server being associated with a company
called Perfect Privacy, and would not be surprised if it was accurate,
but had no specific memory of using the company. COOPER registered a
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) at PAGLIANO's direction and recalled it
being used for more security when users accessed their email from
various computers, and eventually, iOS devices. Additionally, COOPER
vaguely recalled the Windows server using a Microsoft software product
called Forefront.

Continuation of FD-302 of   Interview of Justin Gregory Cooper   . On 09/02/2015 . Page
          COOPER stated there was no official security policy given to
users of the Windows server. Generally, when users received
suspicious emails and forwarded them to COOPER, he would forward them
to PAGLIANO. As an administrator of the Windows server, COOPER would
get emails indicating brute force attacks (BFA), COOPER would also
forward those to PAGLIANO and recalled PAGLIANO installing Internet
Protocol (IP) blocking software in an attempt to thwart the BFA. On at
least two (2) occasions, COOPER remembers making               Special                    b6
Agent in Charge, United States Secret Service, aware of suspicious                        b7C
email received on the Windows server.

          COOPER recalled conversations between CHERYL MILLS and BRYAN
PAGLIANO in or about June 2013 pertaining to the decommissioning of
the Windows server and the next phase of communication infrastructure
for HILLARY CLINTON, after her tenure as Secretary of State in 2013.
Although COOPER wasn't involved and doesn't recall how they were
selected, PLATTE RIVER NETWORKS (PRN) was chosen to maintain a server
for the CLINTONS. COOPER did recall some communication with PRN
regarding the transfer of user names and accounts from the Windows
server to PRN. An individual employed by PRN named      |Last Name                        b6
Unknown (LNU) was granted administrator rights on the Windows server                      b7C
in order to effect the transition to PRN's control. At this point.
Interviewing Agents displayed a document to COOPER identifying
administrator accounts on the Windows server. COOPER identified the
administrator account ’_________ ' as most likely being the user name
for|    |LNU from PRN. In or around July 2013, COOPER received
instructions for his email account that indicated PRN was in control
of the Windows server email data. Due to COOPER'S transition in
employment, his email account was off the server in or around November
2013. COOPER does not know when the Windows server was shut down and
how or where it was transported.

          COOPER had no knowledge of the process HILLARY CLINTON
undertook when acquiring her emails from the clintonemail.com domain
and providing them to the Department of State as part of a Freedom of
Information Act (F0IA) request. COOPER speculated that PRN was
involved in the acquisition of the entire content of her account and
DAVID KENDALL was consulted when determining which specific emails
would be turned over.

          COOPER believed the Windows server had three domains:
wjcoffice.com, presidentclinton.com and clintonemail.com. To the best
of COOPER's memory, he recalled____________________________________                                                 b6
                                                                                                                    b7C

      having email accounts using the domain presidentclinton.com or
wjcoffice.com, as part of their work for BILL CLINTON. COOPER believed
HILLARY CLINTON,_______________ and HUMA ABEDIN had email accounts
under the domain clintonemail.com as part of their association or work
for HILLARY CLINTON. COOPER believed the Windows server was used
exclusively for the exchange of email.

          COOPER has never stored or transmitted classified
information over an unclassified network and was unaware of any
discussions regarding the transmittal of classified information on an
unclassified network by others.

          Notes of this interview, as well as the document displayed
to COOPER, will be maintained in a FD-340 envelope and filed with the

                  After being advised of the identity of the interviewing Agents, and the nature of the
 interview, COOPER provided the following information:

        (U//FOUQ) After reviewing an email referencing a new laptop for HILLARY CLINTON,
COOPER recalled a Macbook Air purchased for CLINTON in the 2008 timeframe, but did not believe
she ever used it. He did not recall the backup drive referenced in the email The Macfrook
                                                                                   dp     was likely
purchased with a credit card because COOPER                                          to CLINTON1s            Jt
accounts and, therefore, had credit cards                                       COOPER was not
involved in the setup of the Macbook, but believed it was setup to access CLINTON's email. The intent
was for CLINTON to use the Macbook in addition to her BlackBerry. In addition to COOPER, HUMA
ABEDIN                           and, later, MONICA HANLEY frequently assisted CLINTON with
setting up any new technology devices,

        (U//FOUO) COOPER was aware CLINTON had Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities
(SCIFs) in both her New York residence as well as her residence in the District of Columbia (DC). The
SCIF at the DC residence!-                       COOPER knew CLINTON to have access to the SCIF
and knew ABEDIN was frequently there, but did not know if ABEDIN could access the SCIF when it
was secured COOPER did not have the combination to open the SCIF. The SCIF doors at both
residences were not always secured, including times when CLINTON was not at the residences. When
CLINTON became the Secretary of State, COOPER assisted the team from the United States Department
of State (State) with questions regarding the communications infrastructure at the New York residence.
Both residences had safes, home computers, secure Cisco phones, secure and non-secure fax, and secure
video capabilities inside of the SCIF. COOPER was unaware o f who would receive secure faxes when
they were transmitted. The only individual at either residence COOPER believed to have a clearance was
possibly________________ as a result o f his time in the military.

        (U//FQUO) Leading up to the installation of the Apple Server, COOPER, for several reasons,
identified a need to setup a private email server located at the CLINTON residence. Those reasons
included:

              •   segregating different aspects of WILLIAM CLINTON's post-presidency activities
              •   separating politics from the work of the Clinton Foundation
              •
                  President CLINTON's office and might attempt to gain physical access to the server if it
                  was located in the office
              •   An outside vendor might not report a hack attempt

        (U//FOUO) After a series of phone calls with Apple, COOPER contracted with Apple Business
Services to setup a server, hereafter Apple Server, for handling email for a small number of users working
in the office of President CLINTON. COOPER did not recall how he paid for the Apple Server, but he
likely used a credit card. Apple installed the Apple Server in the basement of the New York residence,
however, COOPER did not recall if he was present for the setup. The CLINTON family and the staff at
the New York residence were the only individuals with physical access to the Apple Server. The Apple
Server design included a backup to an internal RAID drive. Apple assisted COOPER with the setup of
the wjcoffice domain on the Apple Server, but Apple did not have ongoing access to the Apple Server or
its contents. COOPER was the only one with administrative access to the Apple Server initially, later,
BRYAN PAGLIANO was given access to effect the transfer of data on the Apple Server to a Microsoft
Exchange server, hereafter Exchange Server. COOPER did not assist in exporting any of the data or files
to the Exchange Server, nor did he create any archives of clintonemail.com data. The decision was made
to move to the Exchange Server because the Apple Server did not keep up with changing developments in
technology and, eventually, users experienced problems with email delivery on their BlackBerry devices.

      (U//F0UO) COOPER believed HILLARY CLINTON had an email account on the Apple server;
however, ABEDIN did not have an account, CLINTON either came up with or approved the username
HDR22 for her email address.

     (U//FOUO) After reviewing an email fragment referencing a potential hack of the Apple Server,
COOPER stated he could not recall any details and did not believe the hack was ever confirmed.

        (U//FOUO) CLINTON obtained a new BlackBerry device whenever she had an issue with her
device, such as a trackball failure, cracked screen, or the device was too heavy, When one of these issues
occurred, whoever was working in close proximity to CLINTON would obtain a new device for her.
COOPER believed HANLEY,                    and            to be the individuals who procured new devices
for CLINTON. He did not recall obtaining devices on eBay or similar outlets. COOPER sometimes

assisted others with completing the switch to a new device by leading them through the process of
backing up data from the old device and transferring it to the new device. After these steps were
complete, COOPER would activate the new device on the Apple Server or, later, the Exchange Server.
The two BlackBerry backups previously provided to the FBI by COOPER were likely from situations
where COOPER directly handled the transition between devices. In these cases, COOPER destroyed the
old devices by breaking them in half or hitting them with a hammer.

         (U//FOUO) After reviewing an email referencing the replacement of CLINTON and ABED IN' s
SIM cards, COOPER stated he did not recall a process whereby users would regularly switch SIM cards
in their mobile devices, nor did he recall why CLINTON and ABEDIN received new SIM cards in the
specific situation referenced in the email.

       (U//FOUO) After reviewing an email dated May 30, 2009, COOPER stated he could not recall
any details regarding a new BlackBerry for CLINTON in that timeframe.

        (U//FOUO) After reviewing an email regarding new security policies, COOPER stated Research
in Motion (RIM), provided new tools on a regular basis to increase the security of BlackBerry devices.
Typically, when a user switched to a new device, COOPER would implement an updated security policy
on the device. As an example of a feature he would add to a security policy, COOPER stated he required
users to enter a more complex password. Users on older devices would have the old security policy.

        (II//Ff)I JO) The iPads used by CLINTON were for reviewing email and other content. COOPER
stated_______ [advocated for CLINTON's use of an iPad. Regarding specific iPads, COOPER recalled
an iPad mini and at least one iPad having a cellular data connection in addition to a wireless network
connection. COOPER never set up any of the iPads and, therefore, had no information on Apple IDs,
iCloud accounts, or device passwords. One of the iPads locked out CLINTON's email account on one of
the servers when it attempted to connect using an old password. COOPER could not recall on which
server this event occurred.

       (U//FOUQ) After reviewing an email dated July 26, 2010, with the subject line “Re: CC for
hPad,” COOPER confirmed           purchased an iPad for CLINTON on or about that date.

        (U//FOUO) After reviewing a chart with the heading “202^            COOPER stated he
recognized the phone number as CLINTON's second phone number. CLINTON usually carried a flip
phone with her BlackBerry because it was more comfortable to talk on. Additionally, CLINTON could
use her BlackBerry while talking on the flip phone. COOPER did not recognize any of the specific
phones displayed in the chart.

       (U//F©U0) COOPER stated                                              and he utilized Google
hosting services for email when there was a problem with the Apple Server or Exchange Server. To

effect this change, COOPER would alter the settings on a user's device to check Google for new
messages. COOPER could not recall if CLINTON or ABED IN utilized Google hosting services during
Hurricane Sandy or other outages. If they had used Google, it would have been a team effort to set up
their devices because COOPER was traveling at the time.

         (U//FQUO) After reviewing emails regarding the transfer of an archive of HILLARY
CLINTON's emails, COOPER stated he did not recall providing a laptop to HANLEY for this purpose,
but it was conceivable he could have repurposed a laptop from President CLINTON's office and assisted
in the transfer of the email files. COOPER did not recall a USB flash drive containing the email files. He
also did not recall HANLEY returning the laptop in early 2014; however, he became a consultant to
President CLINTON in the fall of 2013 and was no longer involved in day-to-day business by 2014.

        fU/ZPOtJO) COOPER had minimal contact with Platte River Networks (PRN). He recalled one
interaction with________________ to pass along passwords, but did not have any other involvement
with PRN. COOPER did not have an email account with President CLINTON's office after he became a
consultant.

      (U//FOUQ) COOPER had no knowledge of Freedom of Information Act production or the cull
down process, as it related to CLINTON's emails from her time as Secretary of State.

the identity of the interviewing Agents, and the nature of the
interview, COOPER provided the following information:

           (U//-FGUO) COOPER recalled a personally-owned iMac computer
in the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) of both the
Washington, DC and Chappaqua, NY residence of HILLARY CLINTON. Despite
not knowing the exact model, COOPER described them as being identical
models with a one inch thick monitor.

          (U//-FOUQ) COOPER stated an Apple server was set-up for email
exchange for aides working for former President WILLIAM CLINTON.
COOPER did not recall a specific person deciding to set-up the server,
but more a consensus among aides.

           (U//FOUO) In or around December 2008, COOPER recalled having
conversations with HUMA ABEDIN pertaining to HILLARY CLINTON moving
away from an AT&T provided email account and establishing an email
domain on the Apple server. COOPER and ABEDIN discussed a covert email
domain versus a domain including the CLINTON name. ABEDIN "blessed
off" on the 0clintonemail domain name and COOPER registered the domain
in January 2009. COOPER could not recall who created the handle of
HILLARY CLINTON'S email account hdr22@clintonemail.com, but thought
she typically approved her email account names. COOPER did not know if
anyone else had HILLARY CLINTON'S email account password, but stated
if anyone would, it would be ABEDIN.

               (U//fOU6) COOPER did not have a specific memory of
registering HILLARY CLINTON'S email domain and setting up her
clintonemail.com account on the Apple server. Most likely, COOPER
believed he registered the domain, and added HILLARY CLINTON'S email
account to the Apple server, because he could think of no one else
that would have performed that task. COOPER stated he most likely
initially set HILLARY CLINTON'S hd r22 (jc iin tonem all, com account to
forward to her BlackBerry. When HILLARY CLINTON would reply from her
BlackBerry, her email address would represent as
hdr 22 (?c 1in tonema i1. com. With that configuration, HILLARY CLINTON'S
incoming email content would have resided on the Apple server for a
period of time, but not her sent messages. Again, COOPER stated this
was "all a blur" to him and he was relaying the most likely scenario

          (U//EQU6) In early 2009, COOPER recalled conversations with
ABEDIN regarding moving to another email server system, but could not
recall specifics. COOPER recalled ABEDIN knew BRYAN PAGLIANO from his
work on CLINTON'S 2008 presidential campaign and held him in high
regard. PAGLIANO began building a new email server system in early
2009. PAGLIANO had to have been given access to the Apple server in
order to migrate email accounts and content to the new server he
built. COOPER did not recall giving PAGLIANO administrator access to
the Apple Server.

          (U//FOUO) COOPER did not specifically recall acquiring an
Apple computer for HILLARY CLINTON to use in April 2009. In general,
COOPER recalled multiple attempts to get CLINTON to use Apple
products.

           (U//EOUO) Around January 2011, COOPER recalled receiving
numerous alerts in his email indicating email account users of
PAGLIANO's server were entering the wrong log-in credentials. PAGLIANO
had set-up the server so that COOPER would receive failed log-in
notifications. COOPER thought this to be a brute force attack on the
server and contacted PAGLIANO. COOPER recalled nothing else regarding
this incident.

           (U//-FOUO) COOPER recalled HILLARY CLINTON'S email account
was changed to hrodl7@clintonemail.com after SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL's email
account was hacked around March 2013. Although COOPER could not be

certain, COOPER thought he could have been the one to change the email
address for CLINTON.

      (U//Fero) COOPER thought PAGLIANO had disabled the built-in
Administrator account on the server PAGLIANO built. COOPER had his own
system administrator account on PAGLIANO's server.

      (U//FQUQ) In order for Platte River Networks (PRN) to begin
administerino an email server for the CLINTONS, PAGLIANO gavef
          access to PAGLIANO's server. COOPER was unsure when this took                              b6
place, but thought it was in May or June of 2013. COOPER did not know                                b7C
if           removed COOPER'S administrator account.

     (U//-FOLIO) COOPER could not recall when he last logged into
PAGLIANO's server. COOPER did not know what "IP scanning tools" were.

      (U//F0U6) In the spring of 2013, COOPER recalled giving MONICA
HANLEY a MacBook laptop and walking her through downloading CLINTON'S
email from the PAGLIANO server to the MacBook. COOPER did not recall a
specific purpose for this other than maintaining a back-up copy of
CLINTON'S email. COOPER was unaware of a USB Flash Drive containing
CLINTON'S email. COOPER was unaware of the location of the MacBook
containing CLINTON'S email.
                                                                                                     b6
     (U//PQS©) COOPER stated                                      did not have access to the

                      (U//FOUO) On February 19, 2016, ERIC J. BOSWELL, DOB                   was interviewed by
              Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agentsl                   n<                 at the law
              offices ofj__________________________________                              J Washington DC. Also
              present for the interview was BOSWELL1s attorneyj_                 After being advised of the identities
              of the interviewing agents, and the purpose of the interview, BOSWELL provided the following
              information:

                      (U//FOUO) BOSWELL served as the United States Assistant Secretary for State for Diplomatic
              Security (DS) from June 2008 until December 2012, however, BOSWELL did not resign from DoS until
              the Fall of 2013. Following his resignation from Department of State (DoS), BOSWELL went into
              “When Actually Employed” (WAE) status with DoS, which essentially means he still works for and is
              paid by DoS on an as needed basis.

                     (U//FOU0) As the Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security, BOSWELL was
              responsible for overseeing the security of DoS communications, personnel, and programs.

                     (U//FOUO) BOSWELL did not directly oversee the security of the Executive Secretariat, to
              include former Secretary of State HILLARY R. CLINTON. A Security Officer who reported further
              down in BOSWELL1s chain of command had direct oversight over the Executive Secretariat on the
              seventh floor offices commonly referred to as “Mahogany Row.” BOSWELL could not recall the names
              of any of the Security Officers who were assigned to Mahogany Row during his tenure.

                      (U//FOUO) BOSWELL had no knowledge CLINTON was using a personal email, nor that she
              was operating said email off of a personal server while she was Secretary of State. He first learned of the
              private server and personal email use when it was reported in the Press. BOSWELL further stated he
              found former Secretary CLINTON to be “very responsive to security issues.”

                      (U//FOUO) Agents asked BOSWELL to review a redacted memo titled “Use of Blackberries in
              Mahogany Row.” The memo was redacted by DoS in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
              inquiry. After reviewing the memo, BOSWELL stated the memo was drafted early in the Administration,
              and shortly after CLINTON began her tenure at DoS.

        (U//FOUO) BOSWELL recalled CLINTON1s DoS executive staff initially inquiring about the
possibility of acquiring Blackberries that could be configured for classified material. BOSWELL, tasked
his staff to research the request and possibilities. BOSWELL staff notified him that such a
device/configuration was not possible, which was relayed to CLINTON's executive team via the memo.

        (U//FOUG) Furthermore, BOSWELL stated that he recalled there was general concern around the
same time regarding the possibility that CLINTON's staff might use their Blackberries on Mahogany
Row, which is a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). According to BOSWELL there
was no specific instance or report that any specific person/people were using Blackberries on Mahogany
Row at the time. However, there was some general concern within DoS security personnel that
CLINTON's executive staff may try to use their Blackberries in the SCIF as they were almost all brought
on to DoS from CLINTON's campaign team, and thus were very accustom to using their Blackberries.
Although BOSWELL could not recall a specific report of the use of Blackberries on Mahogany Row, he
stated that “they were told to stop (using their Blackberries in the SCIF) and they did.” DS never
sanctioned the use of Blackberries on Mahogany Row.

        (U//FOUO) Agents also asked BOSWELL to review a redacted email dated 1/24/2009 with the
subject line “Series of questions.” The email exchange, which BOSWELL was not copied on, related to
the set up of a “stand-alone separate network PC” for CLINTON. In response, BOSWELL stated the
email was written three days after CLINTON began her tenure as Secretary of State. LEWIS “Lou”
LUKINS who was included in the referenced email exchange, was the former Chief Administrative
Officer of the Executive Secretariat. BOSWELL explained that a “stand alone” work station does not
necessarily mean a workstation that was not connected to the DoS network, and it just referred to a
normal computer workstation. BOSWELL was unsure if CLINTON ever used a workstation at DoS, and
did not recall ever seeing a workstation in her office.

       (U//FOUO) A copy of the original interview notes and the referenced memo are attached in a 1A
envelope.

        (U//EOUO) On June 15, 2016, LEWIS LUKENS, Date of Birth                                was
interviewed by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agents                        and
         at his residenceX                      San Francisco, CA, A 'ter being advised of the identities of
the interviewing agents, and the purpose of the interview, LUKENS provided the following information:

         (U//FOUO) LUKENS is currently the Diplomat in Residence for the Pacific Northwest region of
the US, for the US Department of State (DOS). LUKENS, a career DOS employee, was most recently the
US Ambassador to Senegal, before which he was the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the
Executive Secretariat. As the Deputy Assistant Secretary, from the summer of 2008 until June of 2011,
LUKENS reported to the Executive Secretariat, who was initially DAN SMITH until he was succeeded
by STEPHEN MULL, LUKENS was responsible for providing operational and logistical support to
approximately 800 individuals at the DOS, which included the Secretary of State, senior leadership and
their staff. LUKENS responsibilities were broken into five main areas: Human Resources, Budget,
General Services, Diplomatic Security (DS), and Information Resource Management (S/ES - IRM).

        (U//FOUO) S/ES - IRM was responsible for ensuring that the senior leadership of DOS had the
Information Technology (IT) tools and systems they needed to do their jobs. The group was led by JOHN
BENTEL and was comprised of approximately 25 to 30 individuals who were a mix of DOS personnel
and contractors. LUKENS interacted with BENTEL on a daily basis. He described BENTAL as having
“decent [technical] skills” despite not being a “tech guy” and added that he was more technically
proficient than LUKENS was. LUKENS was not aware of the statements that had been attributed to
BENTEL in the recent OIG report, but thought they were out of character for BENTEL.

        (U//TOUO) LUKENS worked with CHERYL MILLS and HUMA ABEDIN before and during
HILLARY CLINTON's transition to DOS to coordinate CLINTON's office space and human resource
needs. LUKENS explained that the previous Secretary only had one Deputy Secretary but CLINTON
planned to have two Deputies, so LUKENS had to reorganize the offices on the 7lh floor to accommodate
the second Deputy. LUKENS worked with DAN SMITH and Under Secretary PATRICK KENNEDY at
DOS to ensure that CLINTON's needs were met during the transition. LUKENS stated there was not a
computer in CLINTON1s office at DOS because CONDOLEEZZA RICE did not have one, and one was
not installed for CLINTON.

      (U//FOUO) LUKENS and representatives from DS and S/ES-IRM visited CLINTON'S residence
in Washington, DC during the transition to assess what equipment was present and what needed to be

installed at the residence. LUKENS did not recall if there was a computer in the Washington residence

Chappaqua. LUKENS stated that the PS representative for these visits was mostly likely______
who was later replaced by                   in the summer of 2009.

        (U//FOUQ) LUKENS was shown an email w th the subject “State Department Telephone Services
at Secretary Clinton's Residence” that was sent from                   |to LUKENS and ABEDIN on            b6
                                                                                                           b7C
January 27, 2009. After reviewing the email, LUKENS explained that “IST/Red Switch” refers to the
direct phones to the White House, “Business Lines” refers to unclassified phone lines, and “Ops
Dedicated Drop” refers to a phone line that connected directly to the DOS operations center. LUKENS
was not sure what “CMS VoIP” referred to but thought it was related to DOS Crisis Management
Support. LUKENS noted that equipment was installed both in a SCIF and in an office area located near
                     LUKENS stated that he oversaw the installation of the telephone lines in a very
broad sense but the actual work was very technical and beyond his expertise.

                                                                                                           b6

                                                                                                           b7C
equipment. LUKENS described        as likeable but noted that he often interacted directly with
CLINTON's staff and did not always keep his chain of command informed of requests from, and work
begin done for, CLINTON and her team.

        (U//FOUO) LUKENS was shown an email with the subject “Secretary Residential Installation
Hotwash” that was sent from I   ~fco BENTEL,_______________ and___________________ on March                b6
                                                                                                           b7C
 17, 2009. LUKENS was not immediately familiar with the email or the attachment but believed that
“Server: Basement Telephone Closet” referred to a telephone server. LUKENS noted the installation
processes was unique because there was pre-existing equipment in the residences that had previously been
installed for President WILLIAM CLINTON.

        (U//FOUQ) LUKENS was not aware that CLINTON was using a private email server until it was
released in the papers. Upon learning about the server, LUKENS had some general concerns about how
the server had been protected from hackers. LUKENS did not know if the setup was a violation of any
existing DOS policy at that time. LUKENS never had any conversations with CLINTON's staff or other
department officials about the server.

        (U//FOUO) LUKENS was shown an email with the subject “HRC blackberry” that was sent from
MONICA HANLEY to ABEDIN on August 30, 2011. After reviewing the email, LUKENS provided that
he was unaware of the email and that BENTEL never relayed any information to him about the server or
it being nonfunctional.

      (U//FOUO) LUKENS was shown an email with the subject “S Communications” that was sent
from ABEDIN to MULL on August 30, 2011. LUKENS was familiar with the email and provided the

context that the technology at DOS was not very user friendly and that matters were further complicated
because CLINTON was not very technology savvy and had little patience for technology issues.

        (U//FQUO) LUKENS was shown an email with the subject “Re: Series of questions” that he sent
to KENNEDY on January 24, 2009. LUKENS was familiar with the email and explained that CLINTON
could not have her BlackBerry in the SCIF so his idea was to set up a living room area outside of the
SCIF where CLINTON could check her emails on her BlackBerry. CLINTON did not have a computer in
her office and did not want one because she preferred to use her BlackBerry for checking her emails.
While DOS users can check personal email accounts via the unclassified DOS computer systems the
proposed 'stand alone1 system would have streamlined the process for CLINTON and would have been
similar to the setup used by former Secretary of State COLIN POWELL.

        (U//F0U8 ) LUKENS was aware that no DOS email account was assigned to CLINTON, aside
from a generic account that was used for sending mass emails to DOS employees on behalf of the
Secretary. LUKENS was not aware that CLINTON was using a personal email for official business. He
was told by MILLS that CLINTON was using her personal account to keep in touch with friends and
family. LUKENS did not email with CLINTON directly and typically communicated with ABEDIN, who
he described as CLINTON’s gatekeeper.

      (LI//FOU0) LUKENS was shown an email with the subject “Re: E-mail test” that was sent from
HUMA to “H” on February 27, 2010, LUKENS was unaware of the issues discussed in the email_____
                                                                                                            b6
exchange at that time, but he had since seen the email exchange. LUKENS stated that              I
                                                                                                            b7C
                                who worked in BENTEL1s group.

        (U//FOUO) LUKENS was shown an email with the subject “Re: S berry” that was sent from
HANLEY to ABEDIN on August 30, 2011. After reviewing the email LUKENS provided that he had not
seen the email before and did not know the circumstances in which it was sent. LUKENS did not know
why BENTEL made the statement regarding FOIA searches in the email.

        (U//FOUO) LUKENS had heard of the State Messaging and Archive Retrieval Toolset (SMART)
but was not aware of any specifics about the program. LUKENS believed that SMART had been rolled
out to all departments at DOS and was not aware that it wasn't used by S/ES - IRM.

        (U//FOUO) Once CLINTON's transition to DOS was completed LUKENS' primary responsibility
became coordinating the travel logistics for CLINTON and her team. This included handling matters
related to passports, customs / immigration requirements, baggage, and hotel arrangements. LUKENS
travel on all of the trips with CLINTON.

         (U//FOUO) LUKENS was shown an email with the subject “Communications Guidance for
Moscow” the he sent to several individuals on CLINTON's staff on March 15, 2010. LUKENS did not
recall receiving country specific threat briefs prior to each trip. However, LUKENS recounted that on one
trip to Russia they received guidance from the Embassy that they should leave their phones on the plane.

However, this conflicted with the guidance from DS so they ultimately elected to take their phones off of
the plane. LUKENS explained that the one.state.gov system referenced in the email was used for
accessing the DOS OpenNet system remotely using a user specific pin and token.

        (U//F0W©) On April 5, 2016, HUMA ABEDIN- DOB                           was interviewed by Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agents                      and                  at the FBI
Washington Field Office, 601 4° Street NW, Washington DC. Present for the interview was ABEDIN's
counsel, MIGUEL RODRIGUEZ. Partner at Bryan Cave LLP, KAREN DUNN, Partner at Boies, Schiller
& Flexner LLP and                            Associate at Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP. Also present
was FBI Section Chief Peter Strzok, as well as _                    Assistant U.S. Attorney - Eastern
District of Virginia, and David Laufman,_____            Jand_                 ]from the Department of
Justice (DoJt Counterintelligence and Export Control Section. Prior to the interview RODRIGUEZ,
DUNN and|__________ |agreed to sign a non-disclosure agreement in anticipation of viewing classified
documents during the interview. After being advised of the identities of the interviewing agents, and the
purpose of the interview ABEDIN provided the following information:

       (U//FOUO) ABEDIN first met HILLARY R. CLINTON in 1996 when she was an intern in the
Office of the First Lady. She then worked on CLINTON1s Senate campaign and her 2008 Presidential
campaign, as the traveling Chief of Staff. When CLINTON became the Secretary of State, at the
Department of State (DoS), ABEDIN became her Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations where she was
primarily responsible for coordinating logistics for CLINTON. ABEDIN worked with JAKE
SULLIVAN, CHERYL MILLS, JOE MACMANUS, as well as three Special Assistants, a Scheduler, and
a Personal Assistant while she was in the Office of the Secretary.

Transition to Department of State

       (U//FOUO) ABEDIN and CLINTON met with DoS on a few occasions prior to CLINTON being
sworn into office to discuss her transition. During these instances CLINTON and ABEDIN met with
Secretary Rice and her staff to discuss the logistics of the transition. ABEDIN worked with PATRICK
KENNEDY and MILLS to fill the available spots on CLINTON's staff. ABEDIN was directly
responsible for identifying and interviewing individuals for the roles of Personal Assistant, Scheduler and
Personal Correspondent.

       (U//FOUO) ABEDIN provided that KENNEDY was their main noint of con act for setting up
CLINTON's office and that LEWIS LUKENS, MACMANUS and[                             were responsible for
coordinating the technical aspects of the transition. ABEDIN did not know that CLINTON had a private

server until about a year and a half ago when it became public knowledge and did not recall any
discussion about it during the transition. ABEDIN did not recall any discussions during the transition
about whether using a private email account for DoS business was permissible. However, she did recall
that they were advised that they could not have personal emails linked to a DoS device. As a result
CLINTON elected to use a personal device only because she did not want to carry two devices.

        (U//FOUO) ABEDIN had never held a security clearance prior to working at DoS. She received a
Top Secret security clearance at DoS but did not remember being read into any Special Access Programs
(SAPs) or compartments. When ABEDIN was on boarded at DoS she received a security briefing that
detailed the different levels of classified information and the proper handling procedures. ABEDIN did
not recall ever receiving any training on the preservation of federal records but noted that she took a lot of
training courses when she on boarded so she may have had training on the topic. ABEDIN provided that
she was not an Original Classification Authority (OCA) at DoS.

ABEDIN's Devices and Communication Practices

        (U//FOUO) ABEDIN's office was located in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility
(SCIF) at DoS. At her desk she had both an unclassified and classified computer system. ABEDIN was
not sure if the classified computer system was a Secret or Top Secret (TS) system, and she was unfamiliar
with the term JWICS. ABEDIN did not receive any formal guidance on what system she should use for
the different aspects of her work. She did the majority of her work on the unclassified system and would
often go several days, or weeks, at a time without logging into her classified system. She would only use
the classified system if she was notified that somebody had sent her a message on that system. In addition
to the computer systems, ABEDIN had an open line phone and a yellow TS Cisco phone that she typically
used for talking with the National Security Council.

        (U//FOUO) ABEDIN provided that she was issued an official DoS email account,
abedinh@state.gov, which she used for DoS related work. She also had an email account that was
provided by CLINTON, huma@clintonemail.com, which she used for matters related to CLINTON'S
personal affairs and to communicate with CLINTON's personal staff and friends. ABEDIN also had a
personal Yahoo email account.                                  ABEDIN could access her clintonemail.com          b6
                                                                                                                 b7C
account and her Yahoo account via the internet on the unclassified DoS computer system. She would use
these accounts if her DoS account was down or if she needed to print an email or document. ABEDIN
further explained that it was difficult to print from the DoS system so she routinely forwarded emails to
her non-DoS accounts so she could more easily print. ABEDIN also had another email account that she
had previously used to support her husband's campaign activities,_____________________

       (U//-F 0U6 ) ABEDIN had no knowledge of her accounts ever being targeted by hackers and was
not aware of any intrusion attempts. ABEDIN recalled that some people at DoS had issues with their
Gmail accounts but she never had a Gmail account.

        (U//F0U6) ABEDIN was shown an email dated September I, 2011, with the subject “Fwd:
Calls”, which she forwarded from her huma@clintonemail.com account to her DoS email account.
ABEDIN did not recall the specific email or why she would have forwarded it. However, she noted that
based on the date stamp she knew that she was not in the office when it occurred.

        (U//FOUO-) ABEDIN was shown an email dated October 4. 2009. with the subject “Fwd: U.S.
interest in Pak Paper 10-04”, which ABEDIN received from_________            and then forwarded to her        b6
                                                                                                              b7C
Yahoo email account. ABEDIN was not familiar with the document but was not surprised that she
forwarded it to her Yahoo account. She explained that she routinely forwarded emails from her state.gov
account to either her clintonemail.com or her yahoo.com account so that she could print them. ABEDIN
stated that she would typically print the documents without reading them. At the time of the email,
         worked for RICHARD HOLBROOKE who was the Special Representative for Afghanistan and
Pakistan (SRAP). ABEDIN was unaware of the classification of the document and stated that she did not
make judgments on the classification of material that she received. Instead, she relied on the sender to
make that assessment and to properly mark and transmit the document.

       (U//F0UO) ABEDIN was shown an email chain dated August 16, 2010, with the subject “Re:
your yahoo accf’. ABEDIN did not recall the email and provided that despite the content of the email she
was not sure that her email account had ever been compromised. She further provided that the                  b6
                                                                                                   ]          b7C
referenced in the email referred to                 an older campaign volunteer in Westchester, NY.

         (U//FOUO) ABEDIN was provided with a DoS Blackberry and believed that all of CLINTON1s
top aides at DoS were issued Blackberries as well. The team would sometime use secure cell phones when
they were traveling but they were not used on every trip. Secure phones were only used when traveling in
hostile operational environments. The secure phones were maintained by Diplomatic Security (DS) and
would be provided to the team bvl         I ABEDIN provided that DS routinely provided country specific       b6
                                                                                                              b7C
security briefings prior to international trips. During these briefings the team would receive instructions
on how to handle their communications once in country. For example the team might be told to leave their
phones on the plane or to take the batteries out of their phones. ABEDIN noted that the guidance changed
based on the specific location and that it wasn't uncommon to receive different instructions on separate
trips to a given country. For example, the communication plan for Moscow could be different than the
plan in St. Petersburg.

         (U//F0UO) ABEDIN was shown an email chain dated October 6, 2009, with the subject “IT
security in Moscow” and an email chain dated October 12, 2009, with the subject “Re: Communications”.
ABEDIN stated that the content of these emails was typical of the guidance that was provided by DS prior
to a trip and that the instructions were closely followed by the traveling team, If CLINTON was not able
to attend the DS briefing prior to the team1s departure she would be briefed by DS on the plane. ABEDIN
stated that they used computers that were set up and controlled by the Mobile Communications Team to
access their DoS and personal emails accounts when they were in Russia.

        (U//FOU0) ABEDIN did not recall any potential security issues occurring while the team was
traveling overseas aside from one instance in Egypt. Prior to a meeting at President Mubarak's residence,
the team was unexpectedly asked to leave their phones. ABEDIN could not provide any more details on
what had occurred but noted that DS was with the team and was aware of the incident.

The Secretary's Devices and Practices

        (U//FOUO) CLINTON's office at DoS was located in a SCIF on the seventh floor that was
commonly referred to as Mahogany Row. Her office had an unclassified telephone and a TS Cisco phone
for contacting other agencies. Initially, she also had a secure 'white phone' and a STE in her office but
they were later removed. CLINTON did not have a computer in her office and conducted the majority of
her work in person or on paper. ABEDIN explained that CLINTON could not use a computer and that she
primarily used her Blackberry or iPad for checking emails. If CLINTON needed to check her emails
during the course of the day she would leave the SCIF to check her Blackberry, often going to the eighth
floor balcony. CLINTON's email address was not widely known but all of her senior staff had the address
and would share it with other government officials if they needed it. ABEDIN stated that CLINTON'S
senior staff was not specifically instructed to filter her email but they understood what was relevant to
CLINTON and would only share information with her as appropriate.

        (U//FOU0) ABEDIN was shown an email chain dated September 30, 2010, with the subject “Re:
HbJ on moratorium”. After reviewing the email, ABEDIN could not recall the email exchange or the
context of the email. ABEDIN stated that, in general, she would be told by either CLINTON or the
requesting party if the call needed to be secure or not. It would be unusual for ABEDIN to read the
content and then make her own judgment as to whether the call should be secure or not. ABEDIN stated
that she was likely with CLINTON when she sent the email and she was relaying guidance from
CLINTON. ABEDIN provided that                              land                     were assistants to      b6
                                                                                                            b7C
CLINTON.                             ---------------------

        (U//FOUO) ABEDIN was shown an email chain dated August 30, 2011, with the subject “Re: S
Communications”. ABEDIN recalled the email exchange and provided that CLINTON was not issued a
DoS Blackberry and that she only used her personal Blackberry because she did not want to carry
multiple devices. The email exchange occurred when CLINTON was in the Hamptons and was having
communication issues following Hurricane Irene. At that time, ABEDIN felt that it did not make sense to
temporarily issue CLINTON a DoS Blackberry because it would require significant effort to transfer all
of her emails and contacts to a device that she would only use for a few days. ABEDIN did not know
what STEPHEN MULL meant when he wrote that the account could be set up to mask CLINTON's
identity. ABEDIN1s counsel noted that a longer version of this email chain had been released via the
FOIA process (DoS case F-2015-12685, document C0590567 I).

        (U//FOUO) ABEDIN was shown a memorandum from DS regarding the use of Blackberries in
Mahogany Row. ABEDIN recalled seeing the memorandum in the news recently but did not recall when
it was originally released. ABEDIN stated that she did not need her Blackberry when she was in the SCIF
FD-302a (Rev. 10-6-95)

                         _
so she was not affected by the recommendations in the memorandum, ABEDIN did not remember
receiving a specific briefing from DS on Blackberry vulnerabilities but stated that it was possible that she
received one because DS frequently briefed CLINTON's team on security topics.

        (U//FOUO) CLINTON did not have a secure Blackberry and ABEDIN did not know if secure
Blackberries were even available at that time. ABEDIN stated that CLINTON had several different
standard Blackberry phones during her tenure. It wasn't uncommon for CLINTON to use a new
Blackberry for a few days and then immediately switch it out for an older version that she was more
familiar with. The phones were typically purchased by somebody on her staff and would be activated by
“whoever was around”. ABEDIN recalled that                      ^ a n d MONICA HANLEY helped to                   b6
                                                                                                                  b7C
setup new Blackberries on different occasions. ABEDIN did not know what was done with the old
Blackberries after CLINTON transitioned to a new one. ABEDIN was shown an email chain dated April
15, 2009, with the subject “Re: Won' t get to huma today”. ABEDIN did not recall why they were
activating new SIM cards for CLINTON. ABEDIN provided that]             IfLAST NAME UNKNOWN]
was            President Clinton's office that may have worked for JUSTIN COOPER.

        (U//FOUO) ABEDIN confirmed that CLINTON's Blackberry phone number was 212                                 b6
                                                                                                                  b7C
She was not aware of CLINTON ever using a second cell phone and was not familiar with the phone
number 202             [It is noted that a 202 area code was erroneously used when ABEDIN was asked
about the aforementioned telephone. The correct number is 212|_____        While ABEDIN noted that it
would be odd for CLINTON to have a D.C. area code, she ultimately stated that no part of the number
was familiar to her],

         (U//FOUO) ABEDIN stated that CLINTON had at least one, or possibly two, iPads during her
tenure. She believed that one of them might have been a gift. CLINTON used the iPad for reading news
articles but ABEDIN rarely saw CLINTON carrying or using the iPad. CLINTON was trained on how to
use the iPad by          |while they were on traveling on a plane. ABEDIN stated that the iPad was                b6
                                                                                                                  b7C
briefly used to send and receive emails following Hurricane Irene when CLINTON's other email systems
were down. Although this was only intended as a temporary solution, this capability may have remained
after CLINTON's other systems were restored. ABEDIN noted that she was in Europe when Irene struck
and that HANLEY was responsible for handling the communication issues following the storm. ABEDIN
confirmed that CLINTON's email was also down for an extended period of time following Hurricane
Sandy. However, ABEDIN was in New York City, with her infant child, at the time and was not sure
what efforts were taken to restore or establish temporary email for CLINTON. ABEDIN was unaware of
any email accounts, Apple IDs, or cloud storage accounts associated with the iPads.

Email System During Tenure

        (U//F0U©1) ABEDIN contacted COOPER about getting a Blackberry for CLINTON while
CLINTON was still in the Senate. CLINTON then used the Blackberry when she transitioned to DoS. At
that time, her primary email address was hr 15@att.blackberry.net. Shortly after CLINTON became the
Secretary of State COOPER established the @clintonemail.com domain and CLINTON began using
FD-3()2a (Rev. 10-6-95)




Conlinuation of FD-302 o f______ Interview of 1luma Abedin____________________ . On 4/5/2016 . Page   6

hdr22@clintonemail.com as her primary email. The only other person at DoS to receive an email account
on the domain was ABEDIN. Later in CLINTON1s tenure she changed her email address to
hrodl7@clintonemail.com. ABEDIN was not familiar with the email address
hrl5@mycingular.blackberry.net or with         ~|g)gmail com.                                               fa6
                                                                                                            b7C

        (U//F0UQ) Initially COOPER was the primary point of contact for anything related to the setup
and maintenance of the email system. ABEDIN was shown three separate email chains with COOPER
regarding the operation of the server during CLINTON's tenure. The first was sent on January 9, 2011
and had the subject “Re:”, the second was sent January 10, 2011 and had the subject “Don't email hre
anything sensitive. I can explain more in person” and the third was sent October 20 201 land had the
subject “Re:”. ABEDIN provided that she did not recall any details surround these email exchanges but
noted that she trusted COOPER to fix any issues with the server. She did not recall the system ever being
hacked but assumed that she would have notified CLINTON of any current issues that they were
experiencing.

        (U//FOUO) ABEDIN was shown an email chain dated March 17, 2011 with the subject
“Re: School”. Upon reviewing the email she provided that she was not familiar with the email or the
topics discussed within it. ABEDIN noted that her email address was misspelled on the chain and
therefore she would not have received the email. However, she was not aware of the @ cl intonemail.com
system ever being hacked.

        (U//FQUO) ABEDIN provided that BRYAN PAGLIANO had worked on the Information
Technology (IT) team for CLINTON's 2008 Presidential campaign and was hired at DoS after CLINTON
took office. Thereafter, BRYAN PAGLIANO became the new point of contact for issues with the email
system. ABEDIN did not specify when this occurred but stated that there was a transition period during
which she would contact COOPER and he would direct her to contact PAGLIANO.

      (U//FOUO) ABEDIN was shown an email chain dated December 24, 2012, with the subject “Fw:
Thank You”. After reviewing the emails ABEDIN provided that she did not recognize the
SMSGS@state.gov email address and was not aware of any other generic email accounts used by
CLINTON for DoS wide email communications.

        (U/ffOUO) ABEDIN was shown an email chain dated August 30, 2011, with the subject “Re: S
berry”. ABEDIN stated that she did not like the SSHRC@state.gov email address because it was too
obvious of an email address. She noted that the email appeared to be related to discussions that occurred
when they were working to restore CLINTON's communications after Hurricane Irene. ABEDIN did not
know who JOHN A. BENTAL was but assumed that he worked in the IT department at DoS. When asked
about BENTAL1s statement that SSHRC@state.gov would be subject to FOIA searches, ABEDIN stated
that she always assumed that all of CLINTON's communications, regardless of the account, were subject
to FOIA if they contained related material. ABEDIN did not recall ever having conversations with
CLINTON, or any other staff members, about the Federal Records Act and preserving relevant emails.
FD-3()2a (Rev. 10-6-95)




Continuation of FD-302 o f_____ Interview of Iluma Abedin_______________ . On 4/5/2016 . Page      7________


ABEDIN provided that at the time, they believed relevant emails would be captured and preserved by
DoS if any of the senders or recipients were using an official DoS email account.

         (U//FOUO) ABEDIN was shown an email chain dated December 16, 2010, with the subject “RE:
mail from cl inton email”. ABEDIN recalled that there had been a problem with emails from the
@clintonemail.com system being filtered out by the DoS email system, but she did not recall the specific
email exchange. ABEDIN noted that it appeared that it was SULLIVAN's emails that were affected and
that it would otherwise be uncommon for him to be involved in discussions about email issues.

Email System Post Tenure

         (U//FOUO) Following CLINTON's tenure at DoS she established a personal office in New York
City for the purpose of writing her book and pursing other interests. Several members of CLINTON'S
staff from DoS joined CLINTON's team in New York. They included: ABEDIN. HANLEY]                                            b6
                                                                                                                            b7C

CLINTON's_____________at DoS and ABEDIN described him as being good with technology. He set
up the email accounts for the team so that they would have something more formal than their personal
emails accounts.

        (U//TOU0) When CLINTON left DoS she stopped using the clintonemail.com system and started
using hrcoffice.com to formalize her transition. During this same time period, an outside IT company,
PLATTE RIVER NETWORKS (PRN), was hired to maintain CLINTON1s email system. ABEDIN stated
that PRN was initially hired to manage President CLINTON and I                             Iemails. It was                  b6

then later decided that PRN should also manage CLINTON's email as well.

       (U//FOU0) Once the hrcoffice.com system was established, CLINTON's staff was provided email
addresses on the new system. ABEDIN stated that                   I from PRN, assisted with setting                         b6

        (U//FOUO) Prior to the transition to hrcoffice.com, ABEDIN was advised that the
clintonemail.com system was “going away”. ABEDIN stated that she lost most of her old emails as a
result of the transition. She had only accessed clintonemail.com through a web portal and did not have a
method for archiving her old emails prior to the transition. ABEDIN did not know if the system
administrator had archived the mailboxes before the system was taken down.

        (U//F0U 6 ) ABEDIN remembered having discussions with HANLEY about creating an archive of
CLINTON's emails. ABEDIN believed that the archive was placed on a laptop so that it could be
referenced while CLINTON worked on her book. ABEDIN did not know that the laptop was sent to PRN,
nor did she know what ultimately happened to the laptop. ABEDIN was not aware that a copy of the
email archive may have been placed on a thumb drive.

Review and Production of ABEDIN Emails

        (U//FOUO) ABEDIN provided that she learned that DoS was seeking her emails after she read
about it in the newspaper. DoS wanted ABEDIN1s emails as part of an effort to ensure that DoS had a
complete record of documents from CLINTON's tenure. ABEDIN contacted DoS and confirmed that it
was seeking her emails. She noted that DoS' prior attempts to contact her were unsuccessful because DoS
had an old email account and an old mailing address on file. ABEDIN then turned over her laptop and
Blackberry to her attorneys so that they could conduct the review. ABEDIN was not directly involved in
the review and relied on the judgment of her attorneys. RODRIGUEZ and DUNN stated that they sought
additional guidance from DoS on how the review should be conducted but they never received a response.
RODRIGUEZ and DUNN therefore erred on the side of caution and opted to include anything that they
were unsure about. It was also noted that ABEDIN had previously responded to a similar request from the
Benghazi Committee.

       (U//FOUO) ABEDIN was shown an email chain dated April 2, 2012, with the subject “May -
Asia”. ABEDIN confirmed that the email was related to her activities while at DoS and that it would be
considered a relevant record with respect to the DoS request. ABEDIN explained that this email was not
produced by her team during the review because she did not have access to her clintonemail.com account
when the review was conducted. RODRIGUEZ and DUNN stated that the request from DoS only sought
records currently in ABEDIN's possession so they did not contact PRN to request other relevant records.

       (U//TOUO) ABEDIN was not involved in the review and production of CLINTON's email, in
response to a similar request that CLINTON received from DoS. ABEDIN stated that the review was
conducted by CLINTON1s attorneys and that she was not consulted during the process.

Private Residences

         (U//FOUO) CLINTON's residence in Washington, DC (Whitehaven) had a small office on the
third floor that was converted to a SCIF by DoS. DoS removed the original door and replaced it with a
metal door with a key code lock during the conversion. Inside the SCIF there was a desk where
CLINTON worked and a computer, printer, facsimile machine and a television. DoS also installed a STE,
a “yellow phone” and a video teleconference (VTC) system. ABEDIN provided that the door to the SCIF
was not always locked and that ABEDIN, HANLEY and the                                             had       b6
                                                                                                            b7C
access to the SCIF.

         (U//TOUO) CLINTON’s residence in Chappaqua, NY, was also outfitted with a small SCIF that
had the same equipment as the Whitehaven SC IF, less the television set. ABEDIN provided that
CLINTON was the only person to use the SCIF and that she routinely used the Cisco telephone to make
calls from Chanmnna because the cellylar coverage was not very good there. ABEDIN, HANLEY and
                                                                                                           b6
                                     all had access to the SC IF.
                                                                                                           b7C

        (U//FOUO) CLINTON received diplomatic pouches each night that contained the briefing
material for the next day's meetings. When CLINTON was in Washington, she would be given the pouch
prior to leaving DoS. If the pouch was not ready when she left, or if she was in New York, the pouch
would be delivered to her residence by DS. The pouch would be received by the DS agent stationed at the
house and would then be placed on a bench inside the residence. In Whitehaven, the bench was located
outside of CLINTON's bedroom and in Chappaqua the bench was located near the main entrance.
ABEDIN stated that it was less common for the diplomatic pouch to be delivered to Chappaqua because
CLINTON would typically take the pouch with her when she was traveling. ABEDIN did not know if
           ever received or transported the diplomatic pouch when it was delivered to the residence in     b6
                                                                                                           b7C
Chappaqua. ABEDIN stated that[               did not handle the diplomatic pouch at the Whitehaven
residence because her shift ended before the pouch was delivered at 5PM.

        (U//FOUO) CLINTON typically received the Presidential Daily Briefing (PDB) in person at the
office. When she was not in the office the PDB would be delivered with the pouch or sent via secure
facsimile. If the content was particularly sensitive she might be briefed in person by a CIA officer.

        (U//TOUO) CLINTON would periodically receive both secure and unsecure facsimiles at her
 residence in Chappaqua. In order to receive a secure facsimile somebody would have to answer the phone
 and then wait several minutes for the documents to arrive. Since it was a time consuming process,
_______ would sometimes assist CLINTON by answering or hanging up the facsimile system but he              b6
                                                                                                           b7C
 would leave the documents on the machine for CLINTON or her staff to collect. ABEDIN provided that
________would pick up documents from the non-secure facsimile machine, which was located in a
 separate part of the residence. ABEDIN stated that they had numerous issues with the secure facsimile
 system in the Whitehaven residence and that it was often quicker to have the documents couriered to the
 house from DoS.

        (U//F0U6) ABEDIN was shown an email chain dated March 20, 2009, with the subject “Re:
Tomorrow”. After reviewing the email ABEDIN stated that she knew for a fact that there were times
when_______ assisted with the facsimile machine and may have collected documents from the secure           b6
                                                                                                           b7C
facsimile machine for CLINTON. ABEDIN stated that the intention was to have CLINTON do it herself,
but she wasn't very tech savvy and would get frustrated with the process. ABEDIN provided that the team
would also occasionally email things tc           or           to print for CLINTON.

have_________ call the oval office to coordinate the meeting or call. ABEDIN believed that CLINTON           b6
                                                                                                             b7C
had the President1s email address but ABEDIN did not know what it was. ABEDIN noted that the
President could only receive emails from approved addresses. She recounted that when CLINTON
changed her primary email address they had to notify the White House so that CLINTON's emails would
not be rejected by the server. ABEDIN was not sure how often CLINTON emailed the President.
ABEDIN was shown an email chain dated June 28, 2012, with the subject “Re: Congratulations!”
ABEDIN did not recognize the name of the sender. Once informed that the sender's name is believed to
be a pseudonym used by the President, ABEDIN exclaimed “How is this not classified?” ABEDIN then
expressed her amazement at the President1s use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the
email. ABEDIN provided that she did not go on the trip to St. Petersburg and noted that security protocols
in St. Petersburg were not necessarily the same as they were in Moscow, where they were not allowed use
to their Blackberries.

        (U//FOUO) ABEDIN was shown an email chain dated January 8, 2011, with the subject “Re: AG

exchange and that the original email was sent in preparation for a call between the Attorney General and
CLINTON, ABEDIN stated that she did not have concerns with the content because she was only a
conveyor of the information and that she relied on the sender to properly mark any sensitive information.
ABEDIN reiterated that she did not take it upon herself to question the sender's judgment on how a
document should be marked. ABEDIN stated that people at DoS took the handling of classified
information very seriously. She never had any concerns with how classified material was handled by
individuals at DoS. Nor did she ever recall CLINTON expressing concerns over how classified
information was handled.

        (U/ff6 U0 ) ABEDIN first met SYDNEY BLUMENTHAL in 1996 when she was a junior staffer
at the White House and BLUMENTHAL was a senior official. ABEDIN never worked directly with
BLUMENTHAL but when CLINTON was in the Senate he would send emails for ABEDIN to pass to
CLINTON. ABEDIN did not always forward the messages to CLINTON and BLUMENTHAL eventually
stopped emailing ABEDIN when he realized this. When ABEDIN was at DoS, CLINTON would
sometimes send ABEDIN emails from BLUMENTHAL for her to print. ABEDIN provided that she did
not read the content of the emails from BLUMENTHAL and had no knowledge of his sources.

        (U/ffOUO) ABEDIN provided that she was not involved in drafting talking points while at DoS.
The authors of the talking points depended on the content and were the responsibility of the appropriate
bureau.

        (U//FOUO) ABEDIN was shown an email chain dated September 20, 2012, with the subject
“Re:”. After reviewing the email ABEDIN stated that it was not common to stash the diplomatic pouch in
the limousine but that it would have been secured by the DS or Secret Service (SS) agents that were with
the car. ABEDIN noted that if they were in CLINTON1s car there would be two DS agents present and if
they took President CLINTON's car there would be one DS agent and one SS agent.

       (U//F0UO) There are approximately seven or eight individuals staffed in the Ops Center during a
normal day shift. In addition to the SWO, there are the following positions:

              ♦   Watch Officer (WO) - The WO is typically a junior civil servant who is responsible for
                  gathering important information and disseminating it to Department of State leadership as
                  necessary. They are responsible for answering incoming calls, monitoring cable traffic and
                  scheduling phone calls for senior Department of State personnel as necessary.
              ♦   Emergency Action Officer (EAO) - The EAO is responsible for monitoring international
                  hot spots and other current items of interest for the Department of State. They usually
                  work with the Crisis Management Support team, which is collocated in the Ops Center.
              ♦   Ops Specialist - The Ops Specialist primarily performs clerical work for personnel in the
                  Ops Center. This may include sending and receiving facsimiles or arranging the logistics
                  of meetings or calls for Department of State leadership.
              ♦   Consular Affairs Officer - The Consular Affairs Officer is responsible for addressing any
                  matters relevant to standard consular duties at foreign U.S. establishments.
              ♦   Diplomatic Security (DS) Officer - The DS Officer is a liaison between the Ops Center
                  and the U.S. establishments and Regional Security Officers abroad.
              ♦   Swing Station - The swing station is an extra body that provides support to the SWO and
                  the watch team as necessary,
              ♦   Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) Representative - The INR Rep is responsible
                  for acting on behalf of the INR and for liaising with the broader Intelligence Community as
                  necessary.

        (U//F0U9 ) When urgent information or breaking news, which requires the immediate attention
of senior Department of State personnel, is identified during normal working hours, the Director of the
Ops Center is notified by the SWO. The Director communicates the information up the chain of
command as appropriate. If such information is identified afterhours, the SWO notifies the Deputy
Assistant Secretary (DAS) directly. The DAS will then provide the SWO with guidance on how the
information should be transmitted.

 the subject “Summary of 1055 EDT DPRK Conference Call”, which was flagged by the ICIG as possibly
 containing classified information.                        recalled the events surrounding the email and
 provided that she was the SWO on duty that day and had been directed to convene a call for key
 Department of State officials to discuss the DPRK missile launches. The discussion was based on
 afterhours reporting from the Intelligence Community that was at least confidential if not classified.
I                      could not definitively recall what agency owned the source reporting but believed that
 it likely came from the Central Intelligence Agency.                        ]was on the conference call for the
 purpose of taking notes but she was not an active participant in the discussion, '                    Jcould
 not recall if the call was on a secure line but noted that it was common for such calls to be held on
 unclassified phone lines because not all of the key participants would have access to a secure phone if
 they were at home or traveling.

material, prior to it being sent. [                Inoted that the Deputy Executive Secretary was an
Original Classification Authority (OCA) who would on occasion review material for the Ops Center.

interviewed by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent (SA)                         and SA
                       at the law offices of Wilkinson Walsh + Eskovitz, 900 M Street NW, Suite 800,
Washington, DC. Present for the interview was SAMUELSON's counsel, Beth Wilkinson, Partner,
Alexandra Walsh, Partner and Hal Brewster, Associate. Also present was FBI Section Chief Peter Strzok,
as well as David Laufman£                    and               from the Department of Justice (DoJ)
Counterintelligence and Export Control Section. After being advised of the identities of the interviewing
agents and the purpose of the interview, MILLS provided the following information:

        (U//FOU0) Immediately after completing her service at the United States Department of State
(State) in 2013, MILLS became personal counsel for HILLARY CLINTON. HEATHER SAMUELSON
joined MILLS' firm, located in Chevy Chase, MD, sometime in 2014.

Transition to Platte River Networks Server

         (U//FOUO) When the respective offices of WILLIAM and HILLARY CLINTON began a search
 for a company to operate and maintain an email server, the CLINTON'S financial manager recommended
_____________ as a technology broker. There were no security concerns with the CLINTON1s then-
 current email server operated by BRYAN PAGLIANO (Pagliano server). The CLINTON's wanted an
 outsourced company accountable for the operation of the server. MILLS coordinated the needs for the
 server by providing non-technical guidance to |     ~| which was focused on the end user experience.
 After______ identified several companies as options, the Office of President CLINTON reviewed the
 recommendations and selected Platte River Networks (PRN). After PRN was selected to procure,
 operate, and maintain the server (PRN server), MILLS negotiated the final cost and addressed privacy
 concerns with PRN. Throughout the negotiation process, MILLS consulted with PAGLIANO to ensure
 the recommendations of PRN would meet the end user experience guidance she had provided to PRN.

       (U//FQUO) When PRN completed the transition from the Pagliano server, MILLS did not know
if PRN transferred any email to the PRN Server. Additionally, MILLS did not know what PRN planned
to do with the Pagliano server after the transition was complete.

Department of State Request

         (U//FOUO) In the Summer of 2014, State was in the process of producing materials for the House
Select Committee on Benghazi and raised concerns with MILLS regarding the lack of email for
CLINTON. MILLS met with State personnel                                                an d[
         who told MILLS State had no electronic records for CLINTON, other former Secretaries of State,
and some other State personnel. MILLS understood the issue to be that State's computer systems taped
over backup records after a period of time for all users not on the seventh floor and some users on the
seventh floor. MILLS suggested to State they search State systems for CLINTON1s clintonemail.com
address, while State requested MILLS produce CLINTON1s email. State provided no initial deadline in
the first meeting and followed up with a letter documenting the request. MILLS understood State's
request to be in relation to the Benghazi Committee and not a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
request.

       (U//F©B©) CLINTON asked MILLS and DAVID KENDALL to oversee the process of
providing State CLINTON's emails from her tenure as Secretary of State. As the process was developed,
       Iadvised MILLS it was CLINTON or MILLS' obligation to filter out personal emails from what
was provided to State. Additionally, if State received all CLINTON's emails involving gov accounts,
State would not filter out personal emails.

Collection of Relevant Email

        (U//FQUO) Late in the Summer of 2014, MILLS contacted         ______________| at PRN and
requested all CLINTON'S email involving a .gov account from her tenure as Secretary of State. MILLS
believed                 search for .gov email encompassed email headers, the body of emails, and any
forwarded emails. She was not aware of which mailboxes or other potential locations!
searched for email responsive to her request. However, MILLS did not believe|___________ was asked
to search or searched HUMA ABEDIN's clintonemail.com account. After preparing a pst file of the gov
emails (July Export) based on MILLS' request.r                      Idiscussed different options on thetransfer
of the July Export with MILLS, to include shipping DVDs, but                recommended a secure
remote transfer. Based or[                 advice, MILLS neither requested nor received DVDs
containing the July Export.

        (U//F 0 U 0) After deciding on the remote transfer,|___________ provided MILLS with a link

then clicked an additional acknowledgement giving!                ^permission to remotely access her
computer. [               then transferred the July Export to MILLS' computer and imported it into
Outlook. Once the process was complete, MILLS revoked!                       permission and the remote
session was terminated. MILLS did not know where                    Isaved the pst file on her computer or
if it was encrypted, however, MILLS did recall the .pst file was password protected. Sometime after

MILLS received the transfer, HEATHER SAMUELSON received a similar transfer from PRN. MILLS
never made copies of the .pst file or transferred it to external media.

       (U//FQUO) MILLS' Dell laptop (Dell) was the computer that received the transfer described
above. The Dell was primarily used for work, but was sometimes used for personal reasons. It was
connected to the Internet and had up-to-date antivirus software installed. The Dell was not wiped, other
than PRN actions described later, or reset to a factory state. MILLS continued to use the Dell until it was
turned over to her attorney BETH WILKINSON. The Dell is currently in WILKINSON's possession.

        (U//FQUO) Shortly after SAMUELSON began reviewing the July Export from PRN, she noticed
there was no email from approximately January 2009 - March 2009 in the data provided by PRN.
MILLS likely reached out to                regarding this matter.              Itold MILLS PRN did not
have any email for CLINTON from the timeframe in question. Since CLINTON was using AT&T for
BlackBerry service during that time, MILLS recalled learning AT&T did not keep email records, but did
not recall when she became aware of that fact. MILLS did not contact any other email service providers,
such as Gmail, because she did not have knowledge of CLINTON using another email service.
Additionally, MILLS did not recall attempting to access an Apple server that was once in operation at the
CLINTON residence in Chappaqua, NY.

        (U//FOUQ) After reviewing a document dated July 28, 2014 referencing a conference call
between MILLS,                    and PAGLIANO regarding archived email options, MILLS stated she did
not recall the specific conversation. Other than the conversation described above, MILLS did not recall
any other conversations with                 about the request for CLINTON's email involving .gov
accounts.

         (U//FOUO) After SAMUELSON began the review of the July Export, but before her review was
complete, MILLS contacted|___________|and requested a .pst file containing all of CLINTON's email
from her tenure as Secretary to review it for non .gov work related email (September Export). MILLS did
not instructl                Ito search ABEDIN's email and did not know which mailboxes or email
addresses|__________ [searched to produce the .pst file responsive to her request. PRN remotely
transferred the .pst file to SAMUELSON, however, MILLS did not recall if the .pst file was transferred to
MILLS' Dell. Other than the July Export and, possibly, the September Export, MILLS did not receive
any other .pst file transfers from PRN. However, SAMUELSON, as the one conducting the review,
sometimes contacted!                    directly and received smaller transfers when she identified gaps in .pst
files from                    MILLS never had direct access to CLINTON's mailbox on the PRN server.

Cull and Review of Email

       (U//FOU0) The review methodology employed by SAMUELSON was developed by
SAMUELSON, MILLS and KENDALL, but was executed by SAMUELSON. They did not consider
using any commercially available e-discovery tools for the review and did not consult any individuals

who were not agents of Clinton during the review process. They also did not discuss how to handle
potentially classified emails during the review because they had no reason to believe any classified
material was contained in the emails. Additionally, no emails were identified as containing potentially
classified or sensitive information, therefore, no emails were removed during the review process.

         (U//T0U6 ) The review process called for all email from CLINTON's tenure to be filtered for
.gov email addresses, relevant keywords, and the names of government officials. The review took
SAMUELSON several months and occurred at MILLS' office in Chevy Chase, MD. SAMUELSON
used her own computer for the review and, as questions arose, SAUMELSON would print any email in
question and ask for guidance from MILLS. Emails that contained a mix of work-related and personal
content were treated as work related. Once the review was complete, SAMUELSON printed the
approximately 30,000 work-related emails identified in the review. The printed copies were then provided
to State in December 2014. SAMUELSON produced an electronic copy of the work-related emails which
was later provided to KENDALL at Williams and Connolly. MILLS was not aware of who produced the
electronic copy provided to the FBI or what the file was named. Other than emails where SAMUELSON
requested MILLS' guidance, MILLS did not review the emails identified by SAMUELSON as work-
related.

       (U//TOUO) MILLS was unsure if SAMUELSON encountered duplicate emails during her
review. If she did, MILLS was not involved in any efforts to remove duplicates from the collection
provided to State. Regarding ABEDIN's account on clintonemail.com, MILLS did not know why no
email between ABEDIN's account and CLINTON1s account was part of the production to State. There
was no distinction between the treatment of email to or from ABEDIN's clintonemail.com account and
ABEDIN's state.gov account.

        (U//FOU0) After State began reviewing the emails printed by SAMUELSON, Stated advised
MILLS when specific emails were determined to be classified and instructed her to delete the emails in
her electronic copy, then empty her deleted items folder.

        (U//FOU0) After reviewing an email dated November 24, 2014 referencing an “urgent call” with
 ‘CESC,” MILLS stated she did not recall participating in a call with[           MILLS also did not
recall SAMUELSON having trouble with her connection to the .pst files in the same approximate
timeframe.

        (U//FOUO) MILLS recalled a discussion with PRN where PRN explained, because of the way
Outlook functions, it displayed CLINTON's current email address instead of the email address CLINTON
used at the time each email was transmitted. This issue was not resolved and no emails produced to State
were altered.

         (U//FQUO) In late 2014 or early 2015, MILLS contacted!___________[and requested he remove
all .pst files from her computer. She was unsure if she discussed with PAGLIANO the software proposed
                  ]to effect the deletion. In January 2015,               sent MILLS a link and, in a
process similar to the file transfer process described above, took control of her computer in a remote
session.___________ |checked the computer for the requested files and removed them using software
that permanently deleted the files. MILLS did not know if Bleach Bit was the software used by
                  After he completed the process, MILLS looked withl                     Ito verify the fileswere
deleted. MILLS did not discuss wiping or deletion software with anyone who was not an agent of
CLINTON at the time, nor did anyone other than                    remove files from her computer.

         (U//FOUQ) In December 2014 or January 2015, CLINTON decided she did not want to retain
email beyond a 30 or 60 day retention policy, to include access to any historical content. MILLS
contacted I             land conveyed this change, but did not specifically instruct him to remove any pst
files or archived mailboxes.

         (U//TOUO) In March 2015, after notifying PRN of obligations to preserve materials relevant to
CLINTON's email, MILLS contacted PRN to determine if any backups of CLINTON's email existed
and, if so, where those backups were located. After discussing the matter with PRN, she instructed PRN
to visit the datacenter where the Pagliano server was housed and review it to confirm no records existed
on the old system. PRN could not locate any backup data on the Pagliano server or any of the associated
equipment, however, MILLS instructed PRN to maintain the equipment. MILLS was not aware of PRN
deleting any data related to CLINTON's email in March 2015, nor did she request PRN delete any data, to
include .pst files or Datto backup files. Furthermore, MILLS did not instruct PRN to delete any data
using BleachBit on March 31, 2015.

        (U//F0 U 6 -) MILLS had no knowledge regarding the following topics:

        At the time it was created, an email archive of CLINTON's email, including content from her
        tenure as Secretary of State, created by MONICA HANLEY.
        HANLEY providing the computer she created the archive on to ________         in early 2014.
                       returning the above computer containing the archive in 2014.
        Any transfer of clintonemail.com content to hrcoffice.com.

      (U/VTOUQ) MILLS did noi recall receiving any specific training or guidance concerning Federal
Records retention policy or procedure during her DoS tenure, but explained ii could have happened.

linked to her DoS issued Blackberry and could also be accessed from her unclassified DoS computer or
remotely via a tbh system. MILLS further stated that the DoS fbh system was not always reliable, and
sometimes “went down." MILLS maintained a Gmail account,/_________ hrunuuj.com, that she would                                                            b

account used bv MILLS during her DoS tenure.

        (U//FOUO) MILLS was able to switch over to a classified network in her DoS office. She was
unsure as to what level of classification said network could handle, but knew that it could ui least handle

in person and taken away alter she reviewed the materials. MILLS was not familiar with the J U7C.S

 Google email hacking and woeful state o f civilian technology." In response to the email. MILLS stated
she did not recall the email, but the content was not unfamiliar to her. MILLS remembered hearing that
hackers may have been targeting Gmail accounts, and further recalled somebody siiecestinu her account
may have been targeted, but she was unsure of who provided her with this information,/                       ]

        (U//EOUO) The only mobile DoS device MILLS was issued was a Blackberry-. Most, bm not all.
people al DoS were assigned a Blackberry. MILLS was not assigned a mobile secure phone, but she was
able to cheek one out from the DoS communication team if/vvhen needed.

        (U/VTOUO) MILLS did not travel with CLINTON as often as ABEDIN and/or SULLIVAN.
MILLS only traveled with CLINTON on occasion when she visited Caribbean. African, nr South
American countries. When CLINTON traveled. MILLS ordinarily stayed back in Washington. DC. to
manage DoS in her absence. MILLS recalled receiving travel briefings from DS prior to her DoS related
travel.

         (U//EO UB) MILLS was involved with the team that helped CLINTON transition to DoS. MIL!,.S'
role was to help CLIN TON identity the priorities she wanted to address as Secretary. MILLS also
identified individuals for CL IN'I'UN's staff. MILLS further saw her role as helping CLINTON "balance
her life in regards to the transition." MILLS had no recollection of being involved with discussions
concerning the structure o f Cl.INTON's Information Technology (IT) platform during or after the
fransiiion.

        {U//Mt)U0) Agents asked MILLS to review two emails from February' 2009 with the subject lines
 "Update” and "Recap - Meeting re:Blackberries.*1 While MILLS did not recall the specific emails, she
staled site recalled the issue the emails referenced. MILLS explained CLINTON used a Blackberry to
communicate prior to coming to DoS. CLINTON was not computer savvy and thus was not accustomed
to using a computer, so efforts were made to try- to figure out a system that would allow CLIN i'ON to
operate as she did before DoS. CLINTON did not have a computer in her DoS office. MILLS recalled
hearing that (he National Security Agency (NSA) had secure Blackberry technology that would allow lor
the use of such devices in a SC1E. MILLS requested DoS communication and security personnel research
the possibility of implementing said technology at DoS. Ultimately it was decided that although the
technology existed, it was not feasible to implement the same technology at DoS.

       (U//-LOUO) When asked what her understanding was in regards to who the six proposed secure
Blackberry users were at DoS. as referenced in the email. MILLS explained that the goal was to obtain the
technology for CLINTON because she did not have a computer. MILLS was not aware of who else at
DoS may have received a secure Blackberry had the technology been approved for use at DoS.

        (U//KOUO) The executive suite at DoS was termed "Mahogany Row.” because of the wood
paneling throughout the space. Mahogany Row was a SOIL so the use of Blackberries was not
authorized. MILLS was not familiar with waivers issued to previous Secretaries of State, which allowed
for use of Blackberries in a DoS SCIE.

      (U//EQUO) MILLS was asked to review a March 2009 DoS Memo with the subject line "Use of
Blackberries in Mahogany Row.” The memo, from ERIC J. BOSWELL, was addressed to MILLS.
MILLS stated she "did not recall the memo, but it was not unfamiliar." MILLS believed the memo was in

response to inquiries ami discussions held early on in CLINTON'S DoS tenure concerning the possible use
o!' Blackberries in sensitive DoS spaces. However, MILLS further explained that CLINTON and her
executive staff did not use Blackberries on Mahogany Row because they were never authorized to do so.

        tl!//KOU(-)) When CLINTON wanted to email, she would have to leave Mahogany Row to
retrieve and use her Blaekberry. When CLINTON was inside of DoS ! ieadquarters. most information
was relaved to her faee to face or on the phone. CLINTON also liked to receive and read a lot of
information in paper documents, which is why she would often forward emails to her executive stall" with
instructions to print. MILLS was no! aware of anyone other than CLINTON who had access to
CLINTON'S email account.

        (U//H.JUO) MILLS was not aware of CLINTON ever being issued a DoS Blackberry, nor could
she recall any official request made for Cl.INTON to receive one. Agents asked MILLS to review an
email dated 8/30/201 i with the subject line "Communications.’’ After viewing the email, MILLS stated
that she believed the exchange was in reference to conversations about communication issues during
Hurricane Irene. MILLS recalled CLINTON’S email was down during that time. Agents asked MILLS
what was meant in the email by discussing the creation of a DoS email account that could "mask her
identity, hut which would also be subject to KOIA requests.” MILLS explained she assumed "masking
her idemitv" was in reference to the ability to give CLINTON a pseudonym so her account was not
obvious to outside parties. MILLS also explained she thought that the LOIA reference meant that
CLINTON'S emails from the potential account would bo subject to POIA if the filing party knew the
pseudonym.

        (U//FOUO-) Agents asked MILLS to review an email dated 1/24/2009 with the subject line "Series
of Questions." MILLS stated she recalled the context of the email. As MILLS previously mentioned.
CLINTON did not know how to use a computer, so the suggestion of a stand alone computer for
Cl, IN TON was not an appropriate solution.

        a w rO UO ) CLINTON'S office was connected to MILLS’ office, so she would generally walk into
CLINTON’S oiliee to share information MILLS received from relevant emails. MILLS wanted to create
the best (low of information to the Secretary possible. MILLS stated she had no general concerns on how
DoS business was handled on unclassified systems.

         (U//i'OUOl When CLINTON first came to DoS, she was using an email account associated with
her A f&T Blackberry (hrI .vcr/atl.blackberry, net). and a few months later. CLINTON transitioned over to
the 'dielimoncmai! domain. MILLS did not know why CLINTON transitioned, but was aware of the
transition because she was notified of the change in CLINTON'S email address. MILLS further slated she
was not aware of anyone at the lime, from DoS or otherwise, who was responsible for the email transition.

          (L '//I’OUO) It was MILLS' practice to use her State.gov email when conducting DoS business.

Gmail account. MILLS was not aware of a formal process for providing notification of concurrence
related to a High Value Target (HVT) to DoS Headquarters.

         (U//FOUO) Agents asked MILLS to review an email dated 12/27/2011 with the subject “(SBU).”

any concern over the content of the information in the email being sent on an unclassified system.

        (U//FOU©) MILLS was involved in the development and draft process of some DoS policy
memos, but it depended on the topic. Agents asked MILLS to review two of the same email dated
10/4/2009 with the subject “Draft Holbrooke Team” and an attachment titled “Pak Paper 10-
03dcjjs.docx.” One of the two emails was redacted by DoS in response to FOIA production, whereas the
other was shown in an non-redacted format. MILLS stated she did not recall the information contained           b6
in the email she reviewed. MILLS did not know who would have drafted the memo. MILLS stated she                b7C
was not familiar with the |      |Report.”

        (U//FOUO) According to MILLS, something might start in an unclassified format at DoS, but later
be reclassified at a higher level when that information related to policy matters, MILLS was not sure who
at DoS made the determination to change the classification.

        (U//FOUO) MILLS did not recall any instances wherein she had concern over the way sensitive or
classified information was handled at DoS. MILLS also did not recall any instances wherein CLINTON
shared (with MILLS) any concerns over the way sensitive or classified information was handled at DoS.

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agents                        anI                  lin his office
at the United States Department of State (DoS), 320 2 151"Street NW, Washington, DC, Room 34I7A.
After being advised of the identities of the interviewing agents, and the purpose of the interview, MULL
provided the following information:

       (U//FOUO) MULL is a career DoS Foreign Service Officer. From 2009 until June of 2010, MULL
served as a Senior Advisor to the Secretary of State on Political Affairs. In June 2010, MULL was
appointed DoS Executive Secretary, a position in which he served until October 2012.

        (U//FOUO) MULL later served as the United States Ambassador to Poland from November 2012
until September 2015. Thereafter, MULL was appointed to his current position, Coordinator for Iran
Nuclear Implementation.

        (U//FOUO) As Executive Secretary, MULL oversaw the entire DoS Executive Secretariat in
regards to information processing, crisis management, travel support, and Information Technology (IT).
MULL was more specifically tasked with overseeing the formal processing of information to and from the
Secretary of State, HILLARY CLINTON, and her executive staff, to include the DoS Operations Center.
This also included providing both mobile and in office IT support to the Secretariat.

       (U//FOUO) While serving as Executive Secretary, MULL had very little direct interaction with the
Secretary of State. MULL mostly interacted with the Secretary1s Chief of Staff (COS) CHERYL MILLS.

       (U//FOUQ) Everybody in CLINTON's front office, except CLINTON herself, was on the
Principal Officer Electronic Messaging System (POEMS) system. MULL communicated with
CLINTON's executive staff via POEMS. MULL was not aware how messages sent to CLINTON's
executive staff were relayed to CLINTON, but assumed they were orally briefed.

        (U//FOU0) MULL was aware CLINTON was using a personal email account while at DoS.
However, MULL had no role in setting up or maintaining CLINTON1s personal account. MULL stated
he did not know if the use of personal email accounts was common practice for previous Secretaries of
State. MULL was not aware of a DOS policy at the time prohibiting the use of personal email accounts or
servers. MULL further explained as Executive Secretary, he was responsible for overseeing the formal
communications of the Executive Secretariat, but would not have been involved with providing and/or

maintaining information communication platforms. MULL did not know who assisted CLINTON in
setting up the private email account and server she utilized at DoS. MULL did not know who was
responsible for maintaining CLINTON's personal mobile communications devices, nor who was
responsible for making sure the installation and use of said devices were within DoS policy.

         (U//FOUO) Early into CLINTON1s tenure as Secretary, MULL recalled being contacted by either
MILLS or HUMA ABEDIN who asked about the possibility of the Secretary using an iPad to receive
communications in her office. MULL recalled following up on their iPad inquiry, but explained he
believed it was ultimately decided that CLINTON could not have the iPad in her office because of
restrictions associated with her office being a Sensitive Compartment Information Facility (SCIF).

       (U//FOUO) MULL never observed CLINTON using a mobile device in her office, but recalled
seeing a picture of CLINTON using her Blackberry device on her DoS plane. MULL was unaware if
there was any prohibition concerning the use of a Blackberry on the DoS plane.

     (U//FOUQ) MULL assumed Bluetooth capabilities were disabled on DoS issued mobile devices.
MULL was not sure if CLINTON1s private devices were configured the same way.

        (U//FOU9 ) Agents asked MULL to review an email titled “S Communications,” dated 8/30/2011,
wherein it appears MILLS and ABEDIN ask MULL about the possibility of the Executive Secretariat
issuing CLINTON a DoS Blackberry to use while her personal Blackberry was malfunctioning. MULL
recalled informing ABEDIN and MILLS that while the Executive Secretariat could issue a DoS device,
the DoS issued Blackberry would be subject to FOIA requests. MULL further recalled it was eventually
decided CLINTON no longer needed the DoS device, and thus her request for a DOS Blackberry was
never fulfilled.

        (U//FOUO) MULL recalled receiving information from DoS Security _                                  b6
                                                                                                           b7C
sometime in 2011, indicating there was concern over the possibility that some personal email accounts of
DoS employees were hacked. MULL specifically recalled hearing CLINTON1s Deputy Chief of Staff
(COS) JACOB SULLIVAN's personal email account was amongst those compromised,                        is
currently assigned to the U.S. Embassy in

      (U//F0 U 6 ) MULL also provided the following names of individuals at DoS who had knowledge
of CLINTON's IT setup during her tenure as Secretary of State:
                                                                                                           b6
         (U//F©U©)_                             who worked under MULL was the

           for the Secretary and her executive staff.

Department of State matters. Each mominaf                  1 worked with his staff to generate unclassified
talking points and responses to                                         This process often required the team
to reference classified reporting to ensure that they had the proper context when formulating the response.
The talking points were generated on the low side and were often based on reporting from the relevant
country desk officer. Desk officers were responsible for coordinating information with external agencies
as necessary, and were knowledgeable in howto protect sensitive sources and methods within their
reporting,

        (U//FOUO) Composing unclassified talking points required a continuous and conscious effort to
evaluate if a given piece of information was derived from a classified or unclassified source.
described this process as an ongoing dilemma that they had to work through - How do you talk about
diplomatic conversations in the public sphere without getting into details that may be confidential or
protected? However, he noted that, they had grown up in this environment and knew how to separate
classified information from unclassified statements.           __ provided that he and his team had
received training on the handling of classified information.

        (u//Few©)                 worked very closely with CLINTON and would meet with her four or
five times a day to ensure that|_                         ____________             were consistent with
the thoughts and statements of CLINTON.                 initially traveled with CLINTON and then when
she became comfortable with the position he stopped traveling to manage his team in Washington D.C.              b6
              would typically communicate with CLINTON via the Ops Center when she was traveling,                b7C
              described CLINTON as a “paper person” noting that she preferred paper documents over
electronic communications but he would email CLINTON when necessary. In these instances he would
usually send the email to CHERYL MILLS who would either forward the message to CLINTON or
respond on her behalf. On occasion he would email CLINTON directly.                   did not receive any
formal guidance on what, or when, to email CLINTON directly. This decision was based on his
judgment.

        (U//TOUO)        ______________________________________________ |in the recent CLINTON
email releases many of which were related to the posting of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks in 2010. In
April of 2010,                first began to get a sense of Wikileaks as it began to nost Department of
Defense information. Then in November of 2010 he was notified by
       Jthat the New York Times was preparing to publish a large number of diplomatic cables in
conjunction with a Wikileaks release. Over the next several months                    had regular contact with   b6
           as well as[                                           to discuss cables that there about to be__      b7C
released. Upon receiving a media inquiry or a notification of an upcoming release.
  ___would review the cable(s) in question and then make requests to the media outlet(s) to omit or redact
specific information that was deemed sensitive for operational or diplomatic reasons. These requests
were not always honored and__________ estimated that they had a .250 or .300 batting average. The
Department of State had a rule by which they would not discuss any classified information in the cables
but in instances where the cable was being incorrectly portrayed, or could easily be misconstrued by the
reader,                would provide additional unclassified background information to set the proper
contex for the cable.                  routinely worked with MILLS, and any agency that had an equity in
the specific cable, to formulate the response to the media outlet.

        (U//rOUQ) Wikileaks, and other media leaks, posed a difficult problem for the Department of
State because the information was already outside of the control of the Department of State and was often
about to be published. While the Department of State could say nothing in response to a media
notification or inquiry, the stance of the Department of State was to play defense and try to limit the
potential damage by engaging the media outlet and providing a justification for why sensitive information
should be omitted or redacted.

       (U//FOUO) __________ first became aware of CLINTON's private email account when he                        b6
                                                                                                                 b7C
received an email where “H” was the sender. He initially thought the email was spam but upon reading
the message quickly realized that it was from CLINTON. Aside from the ambiguous username.

             was not surprised that CLINTON was using a personal email account because it is a common
practice within the Department of State,                                                                    b6

during her tenure as Secretary of State. Nor did              have security concerns about anybody on
CLINTON's team, He did not recall any instances where classified information was intentionally sent to,
or from, CLINTON's email account. However, with respect to the emails on Benghazi, he noted that in
hindsight some of the content should have been classified even though they did not believe it was
classified at the time it was sent.

remembered the events surrounding the email. After carefully reviewing the entire email string                   b7C
           gave a brief overview of the Benghazi attack and provided that this email was sent after she
learned that the New York Times was planning to publish an article about the Benghazi attack and the
annex. The topic was of particular interest because at that time the media only knew of the Consulate in
Benghazi and information on the annex had not yet been publicly released.

                       was to notify Department of State leadership when the media was preparing to              b6
release information on sensitive or controversial topics. Alerting leadership allowed the Department of          b7C
State an opportunity to engage the media outlet to negotiate what details should be released and to prepare
an appropriate public response._________ stated that she sent the email in question to alert Department
of State leadership and National Security Council personnel of the upcoming article because of potential
sensitivies around disclosing the existence of the annex. The subsequent messages in the email chain are
responses from other individuals as they discussed a subsequent call that occurred with the New York
Times that afternoon.

emails pertinent to                                   prior to their release, to assess if they contain
information that is either classified or represents an internal Department of State deliberation.

         (U//f O U O f          ^explained that internal deliberations are internal discussions about various
international affairs and policies. These conversations do not necessarily reflect the official, or final,
stance of the Department of State on a specific topic. Additionally, the information may be misconstrued
by the casual reader or cause embarrassment to the Department of State if it is released in its original
                                                                                                                 b6

for redaction under the B5 exception. ___________Jreviews the team's work before it is passed to the next
phase of the review process within the Department of State. [               noted that a significant number of
the items that her group recommended for redaction because they were deliberative products were
ultimately marked for redaction, by internal counsel, using the classified material (Bl) exception.
            did not know why internal counsel elected not to follow her group's recommendations but
noted that as a result a significant number of FOIA released documents that are marked as containing
classified information really only contain deliberative material.

information did in fact have classified material. However, she quickly noted that she did not recall seeing
anything that would potentially compromise national security or be considered criminal in nature.

on the unclassified system SEe gave the example of a diplomat who summarizes a diplomatic
conversation on the unclassified computer system In general, they don't believe such diplomatic
conversations are classified because it is usually obtained through diplomatic discussions and not from
sensitive sources. They would consider the discussion to be Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) and
transmitted on OpenNet with the expectation that it would be contained on the Department of State
system and only accessed by legitimate users.

                  Based on these experiences she is careful not to transmit sensitive information on the

               After being advised of the identity of the interviewing agents and the nature of the
interview, BLUMENTHAL provided the following:

        (U//FOUO) BLUMENTHAL is a friend of HILLARY CLINTON (CLINTON). During her
tenure as Secretary of State from 2009-2013, he served as an informal political advisor by sending emails
containing information he deemed to be helpful and interesting topics. BLUMENTHAL did not recall
sending any such emails prior to CLINTON becoming Secretary of State. There was no set schedule for
these emails, BLUMENTHAL was never paid for his advisory services, and there was no specific
conversation with CLINTON regarding his informal role. However, CLINTON would occasionally
acknowledge the value of his emails in a response to BLUMENTHAL. During this time,
BLUMENTHAL was also employed by the Clinton Foundation where his duties were related to former
President BILL CLINTON, his legacy, and some communications of the Foundation. BLUMENTHAL
reported to                                                      and does not recall what HILLARY
CLINTON's role was in defining his role at the Foundation, During this timeframe, BLUMENTHAL
was also involved with the Clinton Global Initiative.

                 TYLER DRUMHELLER was a career Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee who
served in a number of capacities during his tenure.
                                                                          During the timeframe in which
BLUMENTHAL used DRUMHELLER as a source for information provided to CLINTON,
DRUMHELLER was retired from the CIA. DRUMHELLER knew the information he provided would be
forwarded to CLINTON and provided it because he thought the information would be useful and helpful
to the United States Government (USG). He did not receive any compensation for the information. The

communications with CLINTON. The CONFIDENTIAL marking was meant to imply the email was of a
personal nature from BLUMENTHAL and did not refer to classified USG information.

                   purchased one iPad for the Secretary and could not remember a second iPad, or any details
                                                                                                                     b6
                   of a recovery email account,            jrecounted how after he gave the Secretary the iPad,      b7C
                   the Secretary fell asleep holding the unopened packaging in her arms. This struck
                   as funny because, in contrast, he would not be able to sleep if he had just received a new
                   iPad. He noted that this episode was foreshadowing for how little she would use the iPad.

                   The third email referred to the cover of a People Magazine edition from August 2010 and
                   was an example of when             would use his personal email to send a message to the          b6

                   it referred to the collating of relevant news clips.

              5. In the fifth email the term “Dirty Space” refers to a non SC IF space, where unsecured
                 communications could be used.

                                                                                                                     b6
              6 . The sixth email references the Secretary's transition between Blackberry devices,
                                                                                                                     b7C
                  remembered that her first device was blue in color but he could not recall the make or
                  model             Istated that her second Blackberry was “not blue” but again could not
                  reca! 1any additional details. The second device was remotely activated by COOPER and
                  then          Jprovided it to the Secretary once it was activated. He was unsure if she had
                  additional Blackberry devices thereafter.

              7. The seventh email references a photograph that the Secretary took of the reporters
                 traveling with her while they were in Greenland or Ice and. The Secretary wanted to share
                                                                                                                     b6

                 “identifiers” before sending the picture to them,           stated that “identifiers” simply
                 referred to the Secretary's email address as she c id not want to inadvertently give out her
                 email address.

              8.   The eighth email refers to t le Secretary's house in Washington, D C., on Whitehaven St.
                   While discussing the email             provided that he did not recall any other emails being     b6

                 aside from what is described in the email and that he did not have any other interactions
                 with Platte River Networks. He was unsure who secured the hrcoffice.com domain but did

                 he acted as a paid advisor to the Secretary while she was promoting her book. During this
                 time he used a personal Gmail account until the hrcoffice domain was stood up.

tasked with conducting a policy review of Afghanistan and Pakistan early in President OBAMA's
administration,            Jdid not recall how many different versions of the|      |Report were
generated.

        (U//FOUO) Agents asked                  to review an email and attachment dated 10/4/2009 and with
the Subject: “draft” and an attachment title “Pak Paper 10-03dc.docx After reviewing the email and
attachment]^              explained he vaguely remembered the period of time surrounding the email, but
did not specifically recall the email or attachment.             assessed he would not have been one to
write the document attached to the email, and believed it was likely drafted by somebody in the Special
Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan's (SRAP) Office.                 Iwould have likely been one of
the final reviewers of the document, describing himself as the “Clean up guy.’
who was in the DoS Policy Planning Office, may have also been involved in drafting the document.

         (U//FOUO) Agents drew         _______ (attention to the fact that information contained in the
referenced 10/4/2009 email attachment also appeared as SECRET//NOFORN in a March, 2009, version
of thel       iReport.________ did not know who at DoS would have ultimately determined the
classification of the document,               assessed either CLINTON or someone in her front office
would have classified the document.                 believed CLINTON and RICHARD HOLBROOKE
would have at least read the contents of the report prior to finalization. Specific information contained in
the report was publically discussed at the time, so in                opinion, the document was not
classified. Much of the information contained in the report was originally based from various
contributors' expertise; therefore it would not have been classified. He further stated that while he had no
visibility into the DoS classification approval chain,              assessed the report might have been
considered Unclassified while it was a working document, and later classified when it became an official
record. It also could have been marked classified because almost all documents intended for the NSC are
classified for transmission.

Information Act (FOIA) or the Federal Records Act while at DOS. However, she did receive training on
the Presidential Records Act while she was at the White House. SAMUELSON did not receive any
specific guidance on what documents she should retain when she left DOS.

        (U//FOU0) SAMUELSON provided that she only received two emails from CLINTON while she

        (U//FOUO) SAMUELSON had no contemporaneous knowledge of the decision to transition from
the private server in Chappaqua, NY to the services of Platte River Networks (PRN). Nor did
SAMUELSON have contemporaneous knowledge that an archive of CLINTON's emails was created by
MONICA HANLEY following CLINTON's tenure at DOS. SAMUELSON did not know the location of
the laptop, or thumb drive, containing the archive created by HANLEY.

       (U//FOUO) SAMUELSON knew CLINTON transitioned her email to an @hrcoffice.com domain
following her tenure at DOS. SAMUELSON believed no old emails were transferred from the
@clintonemail.com to the new domain, SAMUELSON did not know how CLINTON or HUMA
ABEDIN accessed old emails after the new domain was established.

Request from DOS

        (U//FOUO) SAMUELSON provided that she was not involved in the initial discussions with DOS
regarding the production of records from CLINTON's tenure. SAMUELSON believed DOS had noticed
gaps in its records and had reached out to CLINTON, and other former Secretaries of State, to request that
they produce any relevant records in their possession. MILLS spoke with the department about this
request in late July or early August 2014 and then asked SAMUELSON to assist with the effort. MILLS
also received a formal letter from DOS Under Secretary PATRICK KENNEDY, in October 2014
regarding the request.

       (U//FOUO) To SAMUELSON’s knowledge DOS did not provide any formal guidance on how to
conduct the search aside from indicating that it was CLINTON's responsibility to assess which products
were work related and which were personal. SAMUELSON stated that DAVID KENDALL and others
from Williams & Connolly LLP served as external representation for CLINTON in this matter,

Collection of Relevant Emails

        (U//FOUO) SAMUELSON had no emails that were responsive to the DOS request before she
contacted PRN. In late July or early August of 2014 she requested PRN provide all emails from
CLINTON's tenure that were sent to, or received from, a “.gov” email addressj__________________|of             b6
                                                                                                               b7C
PRN. extracted the relevant files and then transferred them to SAMUELSON. To transfer the files,
                 sent SAMUELSON an email link that gave him access to her computer after she clicked on
it.                then downloaded the email files onto her laptop and configured them so she could access
the password protected emails via Microsoft Outlook. SAMUELSON described herself as “technically
deficient” and stated she was near her computer while this transfer occurred but she did not pay close
attention to what he was doing. She did not recall the name of the file he transferred to her computer, the
location on her computer where it was placed, or if___________ took any steps to encrypt the file before
transferring it.
                                                                                                               b6

mailboxes on the PRN server were searched. More specifically, she did not know if the emails were taken

from the live mailbox or from the HRC archive that had previously been provided to PRN by HANLEY.
SAMUELSON stated that she just asked PRN for the “ gov” emails and                  gave them to her.         fa6
                                                                                                              b7C

        (U//FOUO) In late September or early October of 2014, SAMUELSON requested that PRN
provide a full export of all of the emails from CLINTON1s tenure to ensure they captured all relevant
emails. SAMUELSON stated this request was not done in response to any identified gaps, but in an effort
to produce all relevant emails,                provided the full export to SAMUELSON using the same           b6
                                                                                                              b7C
remote access process as described above. While providing the full email export to SAMUELSON, he
removed the previously provided “.gov” emails. Upon realizing this SAMUELSON asked!
to give her the “ gov” export files again because she wanted to use it as the starting point for her
collection of responsive records. Upon receiving the “.gov” export for a second time, SAMUELSON
noticed that some of the emails from the initial export were no longer included. SAMUELSON recalled
that there seemed to be a pattern with the missing emails and it involved “.gov” addresses that were in the
carbon copy (CC) line of the email. SAMUELSON again contacted PRN and requested that they provide
the missing documents and in response I               Tprovided several smaller .pst exports to fill the
identified gaps.

        (U//TOUO) SAMUELSON had requested PRN pull all emails from Clinton1s tenure, January
2009 to February 2013. However, upon receiving the above described exports she noticed emails were
missing for the period of January 2009 to March 2009. She asked PRN to double check for emails from
that time period but they were unable to locate any responsive emails. SAMUELSON came to believe that
those emails were not backed up on any server and had only resided on the Blackberry CLINTON was
using at that time, thus making them un-retrievable. SAMUELSON did not have contemporaneous
knowledge of the Apple server and therefore did not make an effort to check it for relevant records. In
searching for other relevant records, SAMUELSON checked the                Slgmail.com account and            b6
                                                                                                              b7C
found one email exchange. SAMUELSON did not contact other associates of CLINTON, to include
HANLEY, to request any records they might have.

         (U//FOUQ) SAMUELSON was shown a PRN invoice #37068, dated August 16, 2014, which
contains the work description “Worked with Heather via phone/remote session to restore access to
archived emails per CDM.” In response, SAMUELSON stated that she did not know what that work
                                                                                                              b6
description meant and that she didn't recall ever losing access to the exported emails, aside from when the   b7C
initial “.gov” export was removed by|

        (U//FOUO) SAMUELSON was shown an internal PRN email from[                       referencing an        b6

urgent phone call with CESC on November 24, 2104, to which she provided she had no recollection of
what the call was about. SAMUELSON was then shown a PRN work ticket report from November 24,
2014, which contains the summary note “Worked with Heather via phone/remote control session on more
specific export requirements.” In response, SAMUELSON stated she could not speculate on what those
notes meant and she was unaware of any activities by PRN to “re-establish connection to HRC emails” in
November of 2014.

        (U//EOUQ-) SAMUELSON was never given direct access to the mailboxes on the server and she
was not aware of anybody else being granted such access. SAMUELSON was never given administrative
access to the server and she was not aware of anybody else being granted administrative access.

Cull and Review of Emails

        (U//FOUO) SAMUELSON stated she was primarily responsible for conducting the review at the
direction of MILLS and KENDALL. She conducted the review over the course of several months and
completed it just prior to December 5, 2014, when the documents were turned over to DOS.
SAMUELSON conducted the review on her laptop, both in her apartment and in MILLS' office in
Friendship Heights, Washington DC.

        (U//FOUO) SAMUELSON reviewed the emails provided by PRN in Microsoft Outlook and
placed any responsive emails in a separate folder. She began by adding all of the “.gov” emails and any
email to or from a “.mil” email address to the folder. She then searched the emails provided by PRN for
any email to or from senior leadership at DOS. This included key individuals such as Under Secretaries,
Assistant Secretaries, Ambassadors, Department Heads, and Senior DOS Aides. SAMUELSON then
reviewed the sender and receivers of the remaining emails to identify any congress members, foreign
leaders, or other official contacts. Lastly, she searched the remaining emails for key words that included
terms such as Afghanistan, Libya, and Benghazi.

        (U//FOUO) SAMUELSON reviewed the sender, receiver and subject line of every single email
during the review. However, she stated that she did not read the content of each individual email if she
could determine it was a work or personal email from the sender, receiver or subject line. SAMUELSON
provided that she did her best to review and identify any emails that were potentially a mix of work and
personal content. When asked how work related emails between ABEDIN and CLINTON may have been
missed, SAMUELSON stated ABEDIN may have kept emails that CLINTON did not.

        (U//FOUO) SAMUELSON did not have a formal process for removing duplicate copies of the
same email from the set of work related emails. She did not ask PRN to assist with this process.
SAMUELSON stated she would remove a copy of the email if she noticed that it was a duplicate but she
did not have a formalized or consistent process for identifying and removing duplicates.

         (U//FOUO) Upon completing the review, SAMUELSON printed all of the emails she deemed to
be relevant. The paper copies were then subsequently reviewed by MILLS and KENDALL and anything
they deemed not to be work related was shredded. The remaining physical documents were ultimately
provided to DOS. SAMUELSON stated that she printed the emails in MILLS' office and noted there is
still a printer in MILLS' office but she was not sure if it was the same printer.

        (U//FOUO) Following the review, SAMUELSON created a digital copy, or a “preservation copy,”
of the relevant documents that were provided to DOS. The files were placed on a thumb drive and
provided to KENDALL. SAMUELSON believed this drive is the same thumb drive provided to the FBI
by KENDALL. SAMUELSON also created a second copy of the documents provided to DOS and placed

them on a second laptop of hers. SAMUELSON was not aware of any other copies of the files. Nor was
she aware of a master copy of all of the personal and private emails.

       (U//F6 UQ) SAMUELSON was shown copies of the thumb drives previously provided to the FBI
but could not recall if any were the same as the one she had used. One of the thumb drives was labeled as
“HC PRIME 2” and SAMUELSON did not know what the label referred to.

        (U//FOUQ) The review methodology was developed by SAMUELSON, MILLS and KENDALL.
SAMUELSON did not consider using any commercially available e-discovery tools for the review and
they did not consult any individuals who were not “an agent of Clinton” during the review process.
SAMUELSON stated they did not discuss how to handle potentially classified emails during the review
because they had no reason to believe any classified material was contained in the emails. She further
noted that none of the emails were marked as being classified.

       (U//FOUO) During the review process SAMUELSON noticed the imported emails displayed
CLINTON's email as hrodl7@clintonemail.com despite the fact this address was not created until after
CLINTON's tenure. SAMUELSON discussed the issue with!                     but she did not fully
understand his explanation for why this was occurring and he was never able to resolve the problem.
SAMUELSON did not consult anybody else about this issue.

Deletion of Emails

        (U//TOUO) In January of 2015, SAMUELSON asked|___________ to remove the exported
emails files that had previously been provided to her by PRN. While she retained separate digital copies
of the emails provided to DOS, as discussed above, she no longer wanted the email exports provided by
PRN on her computer. Using a similar process as described above                ___Recessed her computer
remotely and removed the files. SAMUELSON provided that|_                     Jtook additional steps during
the deletion process so the files would not be recoverable. SAMUELSON did not know what software or
processes were used by|                |but believed that the files would be difficult, if not impossible, to
recover. SAMUELSON did not remember having any discussions with                            about deleting
relevant data from the free space of her laptop. Nor did she recall any discussions with[
about the use of “BleachBit.” SAMUELSON did not recall deleting any of the files by herself before
contacting PRN.

        (U//FOUO) SAMUELSON stated that in May of 2015 she deleted some emails from her copy of
the work related emails that were previously provided to DOS. SAMUELSON explained that she was
notified by DOS, prior to the release of the first tranche of FOIA emails, that some of the work related
emails they had turned over were classified. She was instructed by DOS to delete the files and then empty
those files from the trash bin. SAMUELSON did not believe these files were removed from the thumb
drive she had previously provided to KENDALL.

        (U//F0U 6 ) In or about December of 2014, SAMUELSON was on a call in which the email
retention policy was discussed. She was aware the retention period was changed to 60 days and any older

emails would be deleted. However, SAMUELSON did not direct PRN to remove any exported .pst files
on the server or any mailboxes on the server,

       (U//FOUQ) SAMUELSON was not aware of any other deletions of relevant emails, She was
aware PRN traveled to the datacenter in March of 2015, via her role as counsel, but had not instructed
them to do so. SAMUELSON was not aware of exports or deletions conducted by PRN on the server in
September of 2015.

Devices used During the Review

        (U//FOUQ) SAMUELSON used her own laptop to conduct the review and noted that she also
used the laptop for other work related matters as well. She described it as a Lenovo Yoga 2 laptop.
SAMUELSON stated that following the review she accidentally spilled water on the laptop. Fearing that
the computer would fail, she purchased a second Lenovo laptop and placed a copy of the emails that were
prepared for DOS on it. SAMUELSON noted that the Lenovo Yoga 2 computer continued to work until
sometime last year when it failed to power on. The Lenovo Yoga 2 computer is currently in the
possession of her counsel and the second Lenovo was given to KENDALL and then subsequently turned
over to the FBI. SAMUELSON reviewed pictures of the laptops that were previously turned over to the
FBI and stated that the silver Lenovo laptop appeared to be the same as the laptop that she used.

       (U//FOUO) SAMUELSON stated that both laptops were connected to the internet and they both
had antivirus software installed on them. SAMUELSON did not repurpose the laptops after the review
and never attempted to reformat or factory reset the computers.

         (U/fl-OUO) A copy of the original interview notes are enclosed in a IA envelope.

                 interviewed at the UNITED STATES ATTORNEY’S OFFICE (USAO), 401 Courthouse                                                                                                                    b7C
                 Square, Alexandria, Virginia 22314. LAZAR was advised that the nature of
                 this interview was to discuss the extent of LAZAR's hacking activities
                 related to HILLARY CLINTON'S (CLINTON) personal email server. After being
                 advised of the identities of the interviewing Agents and the nature of the
                 interview, LAZAR provided the following information:

                      LAZAR began by stating that he had never claimed to hack the CLINTON
                 server. SA I    ]then advised that FOX NEWS had recently published an                                                                                                                        b6
                 article which reported that LAZAR had claimed to hack the CLINTON server.                                                                                                                    b7C
                 LAZAR then stated that he recalled the interview with FOX NEWS, and that he
                 had lied to them about hacking the CLINTON server. S A ______then asked
                 LAZAR to provide a complete explanation of his hacking activities
                 surrounding the CLINTON server. LAZAR provided the following information in
                 response:

                       On or about March 14, 2013, at approximately 6:00 AM [Romanian Timel,
                 LAZAR was perusing                 address book. Within it, LAZAR identified                                                                                                                 b6
                 an AMERICA ONLINE (A0L) email account of          Jaol.com, which he later                                                                                                                   b7C
                 determined to be the personal email account of SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL. LAZA.R
                 then made several attempts to access BLUMENTAL's email account. After
                 approximately 20 minutes, LAZAR was able to successfully gain access to the
                 account by correctly answering an account security question, which in turn
                 allowed him to reset the password for the account. LAZAR then utilized the
                 new user credentials to access BLUMENTHAL's account.

                       LAZAR recalled that BLUMENTHAL's account contained approximately
                 30,000 emails, which took him approximately six to seven hours to sort and
                 review. LAZAR downloaded approximately 25 attachments that were contained
                 in the emails, including memorandums (memos) and briefing documents. He
                 recalled that some of those attachments were official memos between
                 BLUMENTHAL and CLINTON. Additionally, LAZAR took screenshots of other items
                 in the account that he deemed to be of interest. LAZAR recalled taking a
                 screenshot of an email that contained information related to the Benghazi
                 incident.

                                                                        U N C IA S S I F T E D / /P © tJ D

                  While looking through BLUMENTAL's account, LA2AR identified one email
            exchange between BLUMENTHAL and CLINTON, where CLINTON was using the domain
            of clintonemail.com. LAZAR reviewed the header information for that email
            in attempt to identify the originating IP address for the mail server
            associated with that domain. LAZAR identified one corresponding IP address,
            which was 127.0.0.1. LAZAR recognized that IP address as being an internal
            routing address and assumed that it was assigned to an internal mail server
            at the AOL service provider. Therefore, LAZAR had no additional information
            about the CLINTON email server, and concluded his hacking attempts against
            it at that time. LAZAR stated that this was the full extent of his hacking
            activities related to the CLINTON email server.

                  After spending approximately six or seven hours in BLUMENTHAL's
            account, LAZAR took a break from the computer which lasted approximately
            two to three hours. When he returned to the computer, he no longer had
            access to BLUMENTHAL's account. LAZAR recalled that his access was
            terminated around 8:00 AM          Time. He assumed that BLUMENTHAL likely                      b6
            made a phone call to AOL in order to reset his password and regain access                       b7C
            to the account. LAZAR believed that BLUMENTHAL resided in         |at that
            time.

                 As a form of normal practice, LAZAR would send the results of his
           hacking activities to news agencies world-wide. After accessing
           BLUMENTHAL's account, LAZAR contacted               at THE SMOKING GUN and                       b6
           advised that he was going to send the BLUMENTHAL information to                                  b7C
           approximately 100 different news agencies, which he had identified prior to
           the compromise of BLUMENTHAL's account.

                 LAZAR recalled using a variety of computer hacking tools for his
           hacking activities, such as ANGRYIP, METASPLOIT, SUBSEVEN, and CAIN AND
           ABLE. LAZAR used a remote administration tool (RAT) as well, to create his
           own malware. That tool operated by splitting an existing malware exploit
           into two pieces, manipulating the hexadecimal code, and then repacking the
           malware for deployment. LAZAR recalled using the SUBLEGEND7 tool for this
           activity. LAZ7iR utilized this technique to send out spear-phishing emails
           to various targeted victims. The malware would ultimately install a
           key-logging software on the victim computer.

                 When asked to elaborate on the key-logging software, LAZAR stated
           that he could not. When asked how he retrieved the results of the
           key-logging software from the victims, LAZAR provided that the software
           allowed him to enter a return email address and the results of the
           key-logger were emailed to that account. LAZAR could not recall the email
           accounts that he used for this activity. LAZAR sent this form of malware to
           approximately 100 different people and estimated that only approximately 15

           of them ultimately opened the attachment. LAZAR did not send any
           spear-phishing emails to users at the clintonemail.com domain.


                 During other hacking quests, LAZAR utilized various IP scanning tools
           to determine whether or not an IP address was online and which ports they
           made available on the Internet. LAZAR recalled using the ANGRYIP scanning
           tool most frequently. LAZAR attempted to use Russian proxy servers for his
           scanning activities in order to evade monitoring by the United States
           government. Russian IP proxies afforded him with faster Internet speeds
           than others. LAZAR repeatedly checked his outfacing IP address in order to
           ensure that he was using Russian proxies.

                 When asked how he utilized Russian proxies with the ANGRYIP tool,
           LAZAR relayed that the tool itself afforded the ability to connect to
           Russian proxies. LAZAR could not provide any additional details on how the
           ANGRYIP tool accomplished this.

                 When asked about other Internet proxy usage, LAZAR provided that he
           also utilized MOZILLA FIREFOX as his browser of choice, and that a plug-in
           was available for the browser which routed Internet traffic through Russian
           proxies. LAZAR could not provide any additional details on how the plug-in
           accomplished this, nor could he recall the plug-in that he used in FIREFOX.
           LAZAR also used the HIDEMYASS website for masking his online activities as
           well.

                In the beginning of the interview, LAZAR recalled using the METASPLOIT
           tool in approximately 2008 or 2009. He stated that he was merely an amateur
           with METASPLOIT and that he really didn't understand how to use it. LAZAR
           utilized METASPLOIT on WINDOWS computers only, from a graphical user
           interface (GUI) rather than the WINDOWS command prompt. LAZAR is not
           familiar with the LINUX operating system. Later in the interview, LAZAR
           recalled using METASPOIT in either 2009 or 2010, during which time frame he
           made a how-to FACEBOOK video that demonstrated how one could take a remote
           screenshot of a user's desktop with METASPLOIT.

                LAZAR utilized the CAIN AND ABLE software tool for password cracking.
           He also used that tool from a GUI rather than the command prompt. LAZAR
           recalled that the GUI had green and red buttons on it. When asked to
           describe how he utilized the CAIN AND ABLE program, LAZAR stated that he
           would use it for password cracking once inside a network. When asked
           whether or not he used it for cracking password hashes that were dumped
           from a system he replied yes. When asked to further describe the process of
           dumping password hashes from a system, LAZAR provided that he could not do

            so in English. When asked whether or not he could describe that process in
            Romanian, he stated that he could not. LAZAR used the CAIN AND ABLE
            software product in either 2010 or 2011.

                 LAZAR used other remote administration tools for his hacking
            activities, but could not recall the names of any of them. When targeting
            an IP address for access LAZAR often attempted to log into it via his web
            browser, by typing the IP address into the browser. LAZAR utilized multiple
            different computers for his hacking activities, none of which he has access
            to anymore. LAZAR recalled working with computers since he was
            approximately 15 years old.

                  On approximately four or five occasions during this interview, LAZAR
            referred to himself as being an amateur hacker and not a professional. On
            one occasion, LAZAR also referred to himself as being a "script kiddie",
            who merely knows how to hack accounts by answering security account
            questions correctly, as he did with the BLUMENTHAL account.

               Present during this interview were the following individuals: LAZAR, FBI,

CLINTON to another email exchange server. COOPER asked PAGLIANO for help setting up new
equipment to support a new email server and for assistance in the administration of the server.
PAGLIANO began work on building an email server at K street using computer equipment from
HILLARY CLINTON'S 2008 presidential campaign. In late 2008, at the time PAGLIANO was building
the server, he did not know HILLARY CLINTON would be Secretary of State or have an account on the
server. PAGLIANO believed the email server he was building would be used for private email exchange
with BILL CLINTON aides.

     (U//FOUO) Around March 2009, once the new server equipment was assembled, COOPER and
PAGLIANO met at the CLINTON residence in Chappaqua, NY to install the server and migrate the email

accounts from the Apple OS X server to the new server. PAGLIANO also recalled that I                           b6
                                                                                                               b7C
           Iwas present, as well as some United States Secret Service (USSS) Special Agents. PAGLIANO
recalled the Apple OS X server to be in the basement at Chappaqua and consisting of an Apple Power
Macintosh G4 or G5 tower and an HP printer supported by Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) over port 9100
so that staff could print from the Harlem office. PAGLIANO installed the new server equipment which
was comprised of a 12-unit (12U) rack with a Dell PowerEdge 1950 used as a Blackberry Enterprise
Server (BES), Dell PowerEdge 2900, Dell unmanaged switch, 3U power supply, 3 terabyte (TB) external
hard drive. Kiwi Syslog Server, and a Cisco Private Internet exchange (PIX) 515E IP firewall (the
collection of server equipment hereafter referred to as Exchange Server I). PAGLIANO stated that he did
not utilize tape backups but implemented “disk-to-disk” backups instead. PAGLIANO began the email
migration from the Apple OS X server to Exchange Server 1 while on-site in Chappaqua in March 2009,
but did not finish on-site and continued working on the migration from his hotel room. PAGLIANO
believed he “popped out” all the email from the Apple OS X server when migrating and that no email
content should have existed on the Apple OS X server once it was migrated to Exchange Server I.
COOPER changed the Mail Exchange (MX) records to ensure delivery to Exchange Server 1. There were
only two system administrators on Exchange Server 1, PAGLIANO and COOPER. PAGLIANO
disagreed with housing Exchange Server I in a residential basement due to having only one unreliable
internet connection. COOPER disagreed and wanted physical access to Exchange Server I. PAGLIANO
never knew of Exchange Server 1 residing in another physical location other than Chappaqua.

        (U//E0UO) As far as the Apple OS X server is concerned, PAGLIANO did not know of any other
function or use of the server, other than to facilitate email exchange. PAGLIANO did not know who
installed the Apple OS X server, but believed COOPER was the only person with administrator access.
Two email domains existed on the Apple OS X server, presidentclinton.com and clintonemail.com. Both
domains were also maintained on Exchange server I, PAGLIANO believed                               COOPER,     b6
                  andf                                                                                         b7C
                                 had email accounts on the presidentclinton.com domain, and HUMA
ABEDIN andj______________________________________________________ had email accounts on
the clintonemail.com domain. Once email was migrated to Exchange server 1, all users could use either
the presidentclinton.com or clintonemail.com domains for receiving email but replies would be sent from
the clintonemail.com domain for users of the clintonemail.com domain. PAGLIANO did not know if
HILLARY CLINTON had an account on the Apple OS X server, but he did not migrate one. PAGLIANO
did not know how users connected to the Apple OS X server.)________[or COOPER would monitor the
printer linked to the Apple OS X server, but PAGLIANO was unaware what, if anything, it was used for.
PAGLIANO believed the people with physical access to the Apple OS X server was anyone who had
access to the basement at the CLINTON residence!                Ihad physical access, but not administrative
access, to the OS X server. Sometime after the email migration from the Apple OS X server to Exchange
server I was complete, COOPER discussed repurposing the Apple OS X server with PAGLIANO.
PAGLIANO believed the intention was for the Apple OS X server to be installed as a workstation
somewhere in the basement in Chappaqua for use by either COOPER o r______

         (U//FOUO) PAGLIANO requisitioned the hardware for Exchange Server 1 from a datacenter at
HILLARY CLINTON’S presidential campaign headquarters at 4420 W. Fairfax Drive, Arlington,
Virginia. He recalled the PowerEdge 2900 to have been a Microsoft SQL server and PAGLIANO did not
recall if he wiped the drives of the hardware used to build Exchange Server 1. PAGLIANO made the
decision to use a Microsoft Small Business Server (SBS) environment on Exchange Server 1 since he had
used it before and assessed it would be perfect for a small amount of users exchanging email. Exchange
Server 1 was only used for email exchange, and although PAGLIANO did enable Windows SharePoint
Services, it was never used. PAGLIANO wanted to use a cloud service similar to that used in HILLARY
CLINTON’s 2008 Presidential campaign, but COOPER disagreed with PAGLIANO and did not want to
use a cloud service. Because of this decision, PAGLIANO used an external hard drive to back-up
Exchange Server 1 using Windows back-up service. To effect this change, PAGLIANO scheduled a task
through Windows for a full back-up once a week and a differential back-up every day. These periodic
back-ups would overwrite on the hard drive in a first-in, first-out manner, For security, PAGLIANO used
Microsoft Forefront on the Dell PowerEdge 2900 as a baseline security analyzer. PAGLIANO recalled
finding a virus, but recalled no other detail, other than it being nothing of great concern. PAGLIANO
chose to turn File Transfer Protocol (FTP) off.

         (U//FOUO) PAGLIANO thought the biggest vulnerability to Exchange Server 1 to be a Brute
Force Attack (BFA). PAGLIANO stated that BFAs increased over the life of the server and he set-up the
logs to alert COOPER of a failed log-in attempt. The Internet Protocol (IP) filtering on the server was
manual using a 515E straight IP block and PAGLIANO used Domain Name System (DNS) for inbound
filtering. On the Dell PowerEdge 1950, PAGLIANO used a Kiwi Syslog server and tried to pull and
review the firewall log files once a month. At some point, COOPER put PAGLIANO in contact with
                     rom the USSS for a reason unknown to PAGLIANO.                                         b6
                                                                                       fold PAGLIANO to
                                                                                                            b7C
also perform outbound filtering of email traffic.

        (U//rOUQ) The back-up hard drive and mailboxes on Exchange server 1 were not encrypted.
PAGLIANO wanted to move toward two-factor authentication using an RSA authentication server for all
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access on Exchange Server I because he thought it was a good practice.
As a test, PAGLIANO installed it on his workstation, as well as COOPER1s, but PAGLIANO did not end
up implementing two-factor authentication and did not turn off RDP access. PAGLIANO stated there
were no security breaches on Exchange Server 1, but there were a lot of BFAs. PAGLIANO knew the
attempts were BFAs instead of users forgetting their passwords because the user names in the BFA
attempts weren't even close to any legitimate user name. PAGLIANO could not recall a specific country
that would attempt an inordinate amount of BFAs.

     (U//TOUO) In summer 2009, PAGLIANO noticed an account on Exchange server I called “H,”
PAGLIANO asked COOPER who this email account belonged to and COOPER stated it belonged to
HILLARY CLINTON. PAGLIANO assumed the account was a personal email account. PAGLIANO
FD-.3()2a (Rev, 10-6-95)




Continuation of FD-302 of   Intelview of Brian Paaiiano      On 12/22/2015 . Page


recalled the email account to be HDR22@ditTtoviernail.com. Later, after SYDNEY BLUMENTHAL's
email account was hacked, HILLARY CLINTON's account changed to HRGDI9@clintonemaij.com.

        (U//FOUO) In summer 2009,                          and                       both Information
Technology Specialists at the DOS, contacted PAGLIANO and asked him to come to the 7th floor in DOS
Headquarters. Once there, PAGLIANO was asked if he was aware of the clintonemail.com domain and
PAGLIANO replied in the affirmative. PAGLIANO recalled nothing further about this encounter
PAGLIANO relayed this incident tq_____________________________ and                             had a
“visceral” reaction and didn't want to know anymore. In late 2009 or early 2010,1                ] reached
out to PAGLIANO again and relayed to PAGLIANO that the use of a private email server by HILLARY                b6
CLINTON may be a federal records retention issue.                   Irelayed to PAGLIANO that he wanted        b7C
to convey this to HILLARY CLINTON's inner circle, but could not reach them and asked if PAGLIANO
would relay this information PAGLIANO then approached CHERYL MILLS in her office and relayed
                 concerns regarding federal records retention and the use of a private email server.
PAGLIANO remembers MILLS replying that former Secretaries of State had done the same thing, to
include COLIN POWELL. PAGLIANO thought he may have also mentioned the federal records retention
issue with JUSTIN COOPER. Additionally, PAGLIANO recalled a third conversation with_____
where|                brought up security concerns and stated that email transiting from a state.gov
account to Exchange Server 1 should be through a Transport Layer Security (TLS) tunnel.[                   ]
stated to PAGLIANO that he wouldn't be surprised if classified information was being transmitted.

        (U//FOUO) PAGLIANO stated the hardware used for Exchange Server I was paid for by the
CLINTON family and through the 2008 presidential campaign and at least some of the hardware was
acquired through US21 Computers. PAGLIANO believed most financial and acquisition matters
regarding the CLINTONs would go through COOPER directly. PAGLIANO performed work for the
CLINTONs without a contract and through contact with COOPER. COOPER wanted to do work under a
retainer, but they settled on an hourly wage.

        (U//F0U6 ) In June 2011 , PAGLIANO travelled to Chappaqua to perform maintenance and install
new upgrades to Exchange Server I. The discs began failing in the 3 TB external hard drive in Exchange
Server 1 and PAGLIANO replaced it with a CISCO NAS storage device. PAGLIANO chose CISCO
because they make good products and he may have consulted US21 Computers as well. PAGLIANO
allocated more than half of the storage space for back-ups of Exchange Server 1 and the rest for file
storage. When uninstalling the 3 TB hard drive and installing the CISCO NAS, PAGLIANO did not move
the contents from one to the other. PAGLIANO simply unplugged the USB connection for the 3TB hard
drive and pointed the server back-ups toward the CISCO NAS. PAGLIANO also added memory to the
Dell PowerEdge 1950, added a Gigabit switch, upgraded to a CISCO ASA 5500 firewall, offloaded
syslogging to the CISCO NAS, bought a CISCO botnet filter and CISCO Intrusion Prevention Service
(IPS) and replaced the batteries on tne UPS along with other various upgrades and maintenance.
Additionally, PAGLIANO ungraded the BES from 5.0 to 6.0 and checked for any software patching.

        (U//FOUO) In the Winter of 2011, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) providing internet service to
the CLINTON residence in Chappaqua went down due to a storm. As a result, Exchange Server 1 was
unable to process email. While the Internet was down, and to ensure email delivery, PAGLIANO advised
COOPER to change the mail exchanger (MX) record for email accounts on Exchange Server 1 to point to
Google. PAGLIANO wasn't certain if COOPER did this or who it was done for, but assumed it was done
for HILLARY CLINTON and HUMA ABEDIN since they were the most concerned about lack of email
delivery.

        (U//EOUO) Individuals with an email account on Exchange Server 1 could log into their account
through any means available to them. PAGLIANO viewed his responsibilities as maintenance and
operation of the server. PAGLIANO recalled HILLARY CLINTON used a BlackBerry as a mobile
device, but could not recall the various handsets. PAGLIANO met with MONICA HANLEY at some
point in 2011 or 2012 to configure a BlackBerry for HILLARY CLINTON, but could not recall any detail
about the device.

     (U/ffOUO) Upon           leaving the CLINTON1s employ and pursuant to a request from                                     b6
                                                                                                                              b7C
PAGLIANO recalled doing an export of 40 Gigabytes of[        email. This is the only export
PAGLIANO could recall doing. PAGLIANO believed he may have done an export of email for
                    but could not recall. PAGLIANO did recall doing an import of DOS contacts for
HUMA ABEDIN onto Exchange Server

       (U//FOUQ) PAGLIANO could not recall accessing the content of email on Exchange Server 1 and
was never aware of any classified information residing on Exchange Server 1.

        (U//FOUO) In early 2013, PAGLIANO recalled the user limitations and reliability of Exchange
Server 1 prompted discussions to search for another vendor to manage a CLINTON email exchange
server. PAGLIANO recalled a conversation withl                         Iand COOPER about I                                    b6
             Icareer aspirations and what email requirements she may need. Eventually, MILLS and                              b7C
___________ weighed in relating to Exchange Server 1 and the end of HILLARY CLINTON's tenure as
Secretary of State. At some point, an individual named I                                    Ibegan the process of finding a
vendor to manage a new CLINTON email exchange server. PAGLIANO did not know____
previously, or how she came to be involved with the search for a vendor. Eventually]   Ishowed
PAGLIANO a presentation detailing three vendors and their capabilities. PAGLIANO recommended a
company called Platte River Networks (PRN). Ultimately, PAGLIANO recalled the decision being with
               and she chose PRN.

       (U//FOUO) Once the decision was made to go with PRN, PAGLIANO recalled communicating
with PRN employee!                    ~lrelated to the transition from Exchange Server 1 to the server                        b6
PRN was going to use. Around this time, PAGLIANO was already 4 to 5 months into a new job as an IT                            b7C

specialist at GARTNER. PAGLIANO gave                     administrator access to Exchange Server I as      b6
                                                                                                           b7C
well as user names and passwords to individual email accounts. PAGLIANO recalled talking to
                once or twice and possibly,                     In order to prepare Exchange Server 1
for the transition to PRN, PAGLIANO also “trimmed” mailboxes and cleared out white space.
PAGLIANO described this as a maintenance process of reclaiming space from old mailboxes, like in the
example of_____

        (U//FOUO) Based on conversations he had or was aware of, PAGLIANO recalled knowing that
PRN was going to use a DATTO service for backing up their server, a CloudJacket device for network
protection, and potentially, two-factor authentication.!   was responsible for establishing the contract   b6
of services PRN was going to implement and ensure they were implemented.                                   b7C


       (U//FOUO) PAGLIANO was shown an email dated January 30, 2014 where a user list was
populated by Platte River Networks regarding their management of a CLINTON email server. Regarding
the email, PAGLIANO did not recognize the mailbox “HRC Archive.” PAGLIANO stated after PRN
took control of managing an email server for the CLINTONs, he had no visibility into the server or the
mailboxes.

        (U//-FOUQ) In what PAGLIANO remembered as the fall of 2013, MILLS called PAGLIANO and
inquired about the effectiveness of two types of software for wiping computer data, but PAGLIANO
could not recall the names of the software. PAGLIANO discussed the difference between “bit” wiping
and deleting with MILLS. PAGLIANO inferred from his conversation with MILLS that PRN was going
to excise data. PAGLIANO recalled using Boot and Nuke software when deleting and repurposing
computers while working on HILLARY CLINTON's 2008 presidential campaign, but didn't recall if he
discussed that with MILLS.

        (U//FOUO) In July 2014, PAGLIANO had a conference call with MILLS and               to
discuss an archive of HILLARY CLINTON emails from her time as Secretary of State. PAGLIANO
recalled that MILLS and___________ were trying to determine why a gap existed in HILLARY
CLINTON's emails between January 2009 and March 2009. In separate conversations with COOPER,               b6
                                                                                                           b7C
PAGLIANO understood that CLINTON used a BlackBerry email address before hosting her account on
Exchange Server 1 and that explained the gap from January 2009 to March 2009. PAGLIANO could not
recall a conversation with MILLS o r___________ after July 2014.

        (U//LOUO) In Spring 2015, MILLS asked PAGLIANO if he would mind talking to DAVID
KENDALL from Williams & Connolly LLP. PAGLIANO agreed to talk to KENDALL and described the
interaction as a shorter version of PAGLIANO's conversation with FBI agents as memorialized herein.
PAGLIANO stated there is nothing he told KENDALL that he didn't also relay to the interviewing FBI
agents.

        (U//HXJO) At this point in the interview, FBI agents displayed documents to PAGLIANO that
were Bates stamped as an identifying mark. PAGLIANO was asked questions as it pertained to each
respective document. The following was provided by PAGLIANO:

       (U//F0U6 ) After viewing a document marked HC-0 0 1 , PAGLIANO stated the credit of
$5,000.00 to his account was a payment, including expenses, for his work in March 2009 setting up
Exchange Server 1. The payment of $8,350.83 in June 2011 was for his previously described maintenance
work on Exchange Server 1, to include expenses.

        (U//EOU0) After viewing a document marked HC-014, PAGLIANO stated the line item
“ 1/11/2011 Conference call with Security team” was the previously described communication with
          ~1 related to outbound filtering. PAGLIANO statedl      Iwas an individual he worked with at           b6
US21 Computers. PAGLIANO recalled HILLARY CLINTON turned off Bluetooth capability on her                         b7C
BlackBerry, while COOPER, and possiblyf           | enabled Bluetooth on their handsets.

                                                                                                                 b7C


        (U/F0UQ) After viewing a document marked HC-008, PAGLIANO stated the “Mailbox kick off’
indicated in the invoice was related to the previously described work exportingl | mailbox.                      b6
                                                                                                                 b7C
        (U//F0U6 ) After viewing a document marked HC-004, PAGLIANO stated the iPad referred to in
the invoice belonged to HILLARY CLINTON. PAGLIANO did not configure the iPad and could not
recall when HILLARY CLINTON started using it, nor any other details related to the iPad.

        (U//TOUO) After viewing a document marked HC-0 I0, PAGLIANO stated in March 2013,
MILLS requested an analysis of Exchange Server 1. PAGLIANO recalled giving Exchange Server 1 a B+
grade and conveyed in his analysis the limitations of Exchange Server 1 and recommendations for a more
robust email system. PAGLIANO relayed the greatest liability of Exchange Server I to be reliability and
referenced the incidents in which the ISP lost power and was unable to provide internet service to the
residence in Chappaqua. PAGLIANO had always been against housing a server in a residential basement
and preferred the security and reliability of an established data center. MILLS did not have an email
account on Exchange Server 1 and used state.gov and gmail for email exchange.

        (U//FOUO) After viewing a document marked HC-002, PAGLIANO stated the virtual private
network (VPN) referred to in the invoice was not for users of Exchange Server 1 and just for
administrator use. PAGLIANO stated he installed the IPS at the same time the CISCO ASA firewall went
in place in June 2011. PAGLIANO fine tuned the IPS over time, fluctuating between turning logging on
and off as needed.

Counsel, Mark MacDouqa11, Partner and                           Additionally,
_________________ from the U.S. Department of Justice was also on the
call. After being advised of the identity of the interviewing Agents,
and the nature of the interview, PAGLIANO provided the following
information:

           (U//FOUO) PAGLIANO did not work on the Apple email server,
set-up by JUSTIN COOPER for WILLIAM CLINTON aides, and therefore, has
no information regarding a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate
registered for the Apple server. PAGLIANO did go through the "full
registration" process for establishing an SSL certificate on the
server he later built, which enabled email to be encrypted while in
transit.

           (U//'FOUO) Based on a request from COOPER, PAGLIANO built an
email server in early 2009 in HILLARY CLINTON'S 2008 presidential
campaign space on K street. PAGLIANO could not recall the exact
address of the building. Once built, PAGLIANO rented a minivan and
drove to Chappaqua, New York to install the email server in the
CLINTON residence. PAGLIANO could not recall any existing computer
systems at the Chappaqua residence, other than the Apple server
previously described to the FBI. When designing the network for the
server, PAGLIANO left the CLINTON'S home internet network separate
from the server - leaving it outside his firewall.

           (U//-FQUQ) PAGLIANO recalled being given a list of user names
and passwords that COOPER asked to be transferred from COOPER'S Apple
server to PAGLIANO's system. PAGLIANO did not recall transferring an
account for HILLARY CLINTON and does not know how her account was
installed on the server he built. PAGLIANO installed an IP-based
printer on this email system with the express intent of allowing the
CLINTON office in Harlem to print at the Chappaqua residence. PAGLIANO
installed regular updates to software on the email server using "auto
patching" every night. PAGLIANO did some work to experiment with two-
factor authentication, but did not implement it on the server because
it would have been difficult to administer. PAGLIANO changed the name
of the built-in Administrator account and eventually disabled it.

          (U/AFOUQ) PAGLIANO could not recall saving a file called
"netstat.txt" When PAGLIANO received a recommendation to do outbound
IP filtering from              at the United States Secret Service, he                        b6
implemented the change.                                                                       b7C


           (U//FOUQ) Around January 2011, PAGLIANO recalled a brute
force attack (BFA) on the server where COOPER was receiving failed
log-in attempt notifications on his email. Because COOPER could not
reach PAGLIANO, COOPER "panicked" and shut down the server. PAGLIANO
recalled nothing abnormal about this BFA and eventually trained COOPER
to insert IP blocks. PAGLIANO made it clear to COOPER he could not
administer the server on a day-to-day basis.
                                                                                              b6

employee at STATE DEPARTMENT (hereafter, STATE) to implement Transport
Layer Security (TLS) between the CLINTON email server and STATE
servers, PAGLIANO did not implement TLS. PAGLIANO understood the
CLINTON email server to be a personal email server and did not see a
reason for encryption.

            (U//■FOUO) In early 2013, PAGLIANO found employment at
GARTNER and conversations began between CHERYL MILLS,                                         b6
                                                                                              b7C

accessed the server was around March of 2013.

Department of Justice (DOJ) Attorney                1 After being advised of the identity of the
interviewing agents and the nature of the interview              provided the following:

        (U//FOUO) [        ________ [role with the email server project for WILLIAM CLINTON and
HILLARY CLINTON, under the account name CESC, involved transporting and installing hardware. He
did not serve as the Project Manager, his normal job function at PRN. His first task for the project was to
pick up the CESC server and support devices in use prior to PRN being awarded the contract for the
project. The server and support devices were located at the CLINTON residence in Chappaqua, NY. In
June 2013                   traveled to New York and drove a rental car to the CLINTON residence.
                  contact at the residence^       ILast Name Unknown (LNU), escorted                    to
the basement where the equipment was located !                ]powered down the equipment and took a
Dell PowerEdge 1950 Black Berry Enterprise Server (BES), Dell PowerEdge 2900 email server (hereafter,
predecessor server), Cisco NSS 324 Network Attached Storage Device (NAS), and an external USB hard
drive, but left the existing firewall and switch.

        (U/ffOUO)                    then transported the equipment to an Equinix datacenter in Secaucus,
NJ where he reconnected the equipment in the same manner in which it was connected at the CLINTON
residence. The goal was to get CESC users back online quickly. I                      landf
who was working remotely, then started incorporating new equipment PRN purchased for the CESC
project, but                did not recall if he set it up before or after transporting the server. The new
equipment consisted of a Dell PowerEdge 620 server running multiple virtual machines, two new
PowerConnect switches, two new Fortinet firewalls, and a DATTO backup device. During this period of
time, the predecessor server and new PRN server (hereafter, PRN server) co-existed. The predecessor
server had the NAS connected, but it did not appear to be configured for storing any data. The PRN
server had a DATTO backup appliance connected to it. After 2-3 days.                         departed Equinix
and did not participate in the day-to-day management of the CESC account. Those duties were handled
remotely by                   Several days later, a CloudJacket intrusion prevention device was installed by
technicians at Equinix. The CloudJacket was designed to alert PRN and prevent intrusions into the PRN
server.

expensive and PRN pays for license fees for each copy it uses,                  review of the predecessor

of the interviewing agents, and the purpose of the interview, BENTEL provided the following
information:

        (U//FOU0) BENTEL served at the US Department of State (DOS) for 39 years before retiring in
2012. Most recently, BENTEL was the Director of the Executive Secretariat Information Resource
Management (S/ES-IRM) from 2008 until 2012. In this position he reported to LEWIS LUKENS and
then to TULINABO (TULD MUSHING! Approximately 85 people were under BENTEL's supervision,
including two deputies:__________________ (and

        (U//FOUQ) BENTEL did not learn that HILLARY CLINTON was using a private email server
while she was at DOS until it came out in the press last year. He had no knowledge of the server while he
was at DOS. BENTEL met BRYAN PAGLIANO while he was at DOS and knew that he worked for IRM
but he did not know that he was also providing support to the CLINTON server.

        (U//FQUO) BENTEL was shown a copy of an email sent from                         to BENTEL,
                         and                      on March 17, 2009, with the subject “Secretary
Residential Installation Hot wash.” BENTEL provided that]___ was responsible for setting up secure
communications in CLINTON's office and residence, and thatj                was a contractor in
section. After reviewing the email and its attachment, BENTEL stated that he did not recall the email and
that he might not have read the email originally because he and his two deputies functioned as “a
collective.” BENTEL stated that the attachment appeared to be a summary of the communication
equipment in CLINTON's residence at the start of her tenure. BENTEL did not know what the “Server:
Basement Telephone Closet” listed in the attachment referred to. He then speculated that it might be a
server for telephones. Upon further questioning, BENTEL provided that he did not know if DOS used or
installed servers to support its telephone equipment.

      (U/yFeW©) BENTEL was shown an email sent from MONICA HANLEY to HUMA ABEDIN
on August 30, 2011 with the subject “HRC blackberry” that referenced a discussion between HANLEY

and BENTEL. Upon reviewing the document BENTEL provided that he did not recall the email and that
he would not have used the term “chapp server.” Furthermore, he did not recall CLINTON losing access
to her email following Hurricane Irene or any related discussions. BENTEL explained that he did not
have a lot of direct interaction with CLINTON's staff and that communication issues would likely be        b6
                                                                                                           b7C
handled bvl                      from the “tech team.

        (U//FOUO) BENTEL was aware of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) report from May of
2016 in which it was reported that subordinates raised concerns about the Secretary's server to BENTEL
in 2010 and he instructed them not to discuss the matter any further. BENTEL denied that anybody had
raised such concerns to him, He further stated that the account provided by the OIG report was
inconsistent with his open and welcoming management style.

        (U//FOUO) BENTEL stated that he did not know CLINTON was using a personal email account
for DOS business until after it was released in the papers. BENTEL clarified he knew that CLINTON had
a personal email account but that he did not know that she was using it for work related matters. BENTEL
did not know if CLINTON had a DOS issued email account.

        (U//FOUO) BENTEL was shown an email that he sent to MONICA HANLEY on August 30,
2011 with the subject “Re: S berry.” The email discusses a DOS issued email account,
SSHRC@state.gov, which had been previously established for CLINTON. In the email, BENTEL wrote
that emails on the account would be subject to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) searches. Upon
reviewing the email, BENTEL stated that he did not recall the email exchange or the details surrounding
the use of SSHRC@state.gov, noting that the account was likely set up by the system administrator.
BENTEL included the caveat about FOIA to make sure that HANLEY was aware of FOIA and that any
personal messages on the account would also be subjected to FOIA requests. BENTEL stated his group
                                                                                                           b6

within S/ES-IRM was

        (U//FOUO) BENTEL was aware of the State Messaging Archive Retrieval Toolset (SMART) and
said it was not used by S/ES-IRM during CLINTON's tenure. BENTEL speculated that it was not rolled
out to S/ES-IRM at that time because it was a new system and they wanted to work out any bugs before
giving it to the executives. BENTEL stated that STEPHEN MULL would have made the final decision on
rolling out SMART to S/ES-IRM.

After being advised of the identity of the interviewing agents and the nature of the interview, POWELL
provided the following:

        (U//FOUO) In his book, It Worked for Me: In Life and Leadership, POWELL wrote a chapter
called Brainware outlining his efforts to modernize computer systems at the US Department of State,
hereafter State. When he was sworn in as Secretary of State in 2001, one of the largest problems at State
was outdated Information Technology (IT) systems. At the time. State and the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) would swap responsibility every 12 months for the communication connections to overseas
embassies. Sometime thereafter. Congress passed a law establishing a White House agency with the
responsibility for secure diplomatic telecommunications. POWELL convinced the administration to give
him time to assess the situation, so he launched a study to determine the agency best suited to maintain
the communication connections. The study found CIA as the most competent, so POWELL fired State
and reached an agreement with the then CIA Director GEORGE TENET where POWELL would select
and evaluate the CIA staff person in charge of the system. Additionally, the system would be based on
POWELL's requirements.

        (U//FOUO) In 2001, few State employees had a computer at their desks. Typically, there was one
computer per office, so POWELL budgeted for the purchase of 44,000 computers and put one on every
embassy desk. The project was done in-house without contractors. To convince and encourage others to
use computers, POWELL frequently used his to set an example. When traveling to visit embassies, he
would sit down at a random computer in each embassy and attempt to login to his account. This action
allowed POWELL to gauge if the embassy staff was maintaining and using their computers.
Additionally, he would frequently look up Country Notes pages on the State intranet to determine if the
various bureaus of State were keeping their information up to date. On his desk at State, POWELL had a
State classified computer and a laptop with a 56kbps modem, The modem was used to access
POWELL's personal American Online (AOL) account. He viewed his personal email much like a home
telephone line in that it could be used for personal and business purposes. At times, POWELL would
correspond with foreign leaders by email. If the conversation became sensitive, whether with foreign
leaders or other USG personnel, he would arrange for a secure call.

       (U//PQUO) The IT transformation revolutionized business at State. With a computer on every
desktop, the time and space problems were eliminated when sharing information. Prior to the IT
deployment, embassies communicated via cables.

         (U//FOUO) The State Inspector General (IG) and Intelligence Community Inspector General
(ICIG) both wrote POWELL to ask him if he had any emails from his time as Secretary of State.
However, POWELL took no emails with him when he left State and knew of no official record
requirements at the time, however, State claimed they were capturing any data necessary. POWELL has
not been able to get a straight answer from the federal archives regarding what record requirements were
at the time. He is concerned the current environment will discourage open communication and the use of
email, ultimately harming US Government efficiency.

        (U//FOUQ) When POWELL traveled for State business, a team would put a computer in his hotel
room for general use, but he would also have access to State systems. Some threat countries would have
additional security requirements such as                                                 If the need arose
to have a classified conversation, POWELL would go to a secure facility, such as the local embassy, b i per

    (U//FOUO) In response to reviewing the email attached to this communication in a 1A,
POWELL provided the following:

         (U//F0U6 ) During POWELL's first few weeks at State, he received several security briefings that
restricted his ability to communicate. He was admonished that CIA and NSA did not want personal
digital assistants (PDAs) inside of SCIFs, even if the PDA did not have wireless capabilities. He
requested briefings to explain why PDAs were any more of a risk than the television remote controls in
the SCIF, but was not convinced of the risks. As a result of these experiences, he advised HILLARY
CLINTON, when she became Secretary of State, to resist restrictions that would inhibit her ability to
communicate.
