Connolly LLP (Williams & Connolly), counsel for Clinton, confirmed to the Department of
Justice (DOJ) that a review of the iMac was conducted, pursuant to a request by DOJ, and no e-
mails were found belonging to Clinton from the period of her tenure as Secretary of State.

(U//FOUQ) Pagliano and Cooper both had administrative accounts on the Pagliano Server.50 At
Cooper's direction, Pagliano handled all software upgrades and general maintenance.51 Cooper
described his role as “the customer service face,” and he could add users or reset passwords on
the e-mail server.52 Cooper and Pagliano both handled the acquisition and purchase of server-
related items.53 For example, in March 2009, Cooper registered a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)1
encryption certificate at Pagliano's direction for added security when users accessed their e-mail
from various computers and devices.54,55 Clinton stated she had no knowledge of the hardware,
software, or security protocols used to construct and operate the servers.56 When she experienced
technical issues with her e-mail account she contacted Cooper for assistance in resolving those
issues.57

(U//FOUQ) Pagliano stated that a complete backup of the Pagliano Server was made on a
Seagate external hard drive once a week and a differential backup™ was completed every day,
and this continued from the initial Pagliano Server installation in March 2009 until June 2011
when the external hard drive was replaced.58 As space on the hard drive ran out, backups were
deleted on a “first in, first out” basis.59 In June 2011, Pagliano replaced the Seagate external hard
drive with a Cisco Network Attached Storage (NAS) device, to store backups of the server.60
The FBI was unable to forensically determine how frequently the NAS captured backups of the
Pagliano Server.

(U//FOUO) According to Pagliano, in early 2013, due to user limitations and reliability concerns
regarding the Pagliano Server, staff for Clinton and President Clinton discussed future e-mail
server options, and a search was initiated to find a vendor to manage a Clinton e-mail server".61
Additionally, Pagliano's expressed desire to seek new employment contributed to the decision to
move to a new server. 62 A search for the new vendor was facilitated with the assistance o:                                              b6

through a mutual business associate.6!         Stated she worked with Mills and Pagliano to
produce a request for proposal which was used to solicit responses from multiple firms,
including Denver-based information technology firm Platte River Networks (PRN). Clinton
recalled that the transition to the PRN Server was initiated by President Clinton's aides seeking a
higher level of service than could be provided by the Pagliano Server.68 Pagliano identified
President Clinton's                                             as making the final decision to                                          b6

I (U) SSL is a security protocol used to establish an encrypted connection between a server and another machine, allowing
sensitive information such as login credentials or credit card information to be transmitted in an encrypted format instead of in
plain text. SSL certificates, issued by a third-party Certificate Authority, are small files that must be installed on servers to
establish secure sessions with web browsers.
m(U) A differential backup is a cumulative backup of all changes that have occurred since the last full backup.
