take multiple snapshots of the server system daily, with a retention period of 60 days.93 The           b7C
backup device also made multiple copies of the Pagliano Server between June 24, 2013 and
December 23, 2013. At the Clintons' request, PRN only intended that the backup device store
local copies of the backups.95,96 However, in August 2015, Datto informed PRN that, due to a

                          the PRN Server was also backing up the server to Datto's secure cloud

encrypted such that no one but the users could read the content.101 However, PRN ultimately did
not configure the e-mail settings this way to allow system administrators to troubleshoot
problems occurring within user accounts.102

(U//FOUO) PRN utilized an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)/Intrusion Prevention System
(IPS) called CloudJacket from SECNAP Network Security. The IDS/IPS device implemented
by PRN had pre-configured settings that blocked or blacklisted certain e-mail traffic identified as
potentially harmful and provided real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident response
services.104 105 SECNAP personnel would receive notifications when certain activity on the
network triggered an alert.106 These notifications were reviewed by SECNAP personnel and, at
times, additional follow-up was conducted with PRN in order to ascertain whether specific
activity on the network was normal or anomalous.107 Occasionally, SECNAP would send e-mail
notifications to|          | prompting him to block certain IP addresses. 108|           described      b6

           stated that he put two firewalls in place for redundancy in case one went down. no

(U//FOUO) According to the FBI's forensic analysis of the server system, on December 3, 2013,
Microsoft Exchange was uninstalled on the Pagliano Server.111 The Pagliano Server remained in
the same server cage at the Equinix datacenter in Secaucus, New Jersey, and a forensic review of
the server, which was obtained in August 2015 via consent provided by Clinton through
Williams & Connolly, indicated that it continued to be powered on and off multiple times before
the FBI obtained it.112 At the time of the FBI's acquisition of the Pagliano Server, Williams &
Connolly did not advise the US Government (USG) of the existence of the additional equipment
associated with the Pagliano Server, or that Clinton's clintonemail.com e-mails had been
migrated to the successor PRN Server remaining at Equinix. The FBI's subsequent investigation
identified this additional equipment and revealed the e-mail migration. As a result, on October 3,
2015, the FBI obtained, via consent provided by Clinton through Williams & Connolly, both the
remaining Pagliano Server equipment and the PRN Server, which had remained operational and
was hosting Clinton's personal e-mail account until it was disconnected and produced to the
