(U//F00Q) Investigation determined Clinton and Abedin began using new e-mail accounts on
the domain hrcoffice.com in December 2014.11
                                                                                                                                  b3

                         118,119 Abedin stated the clintonemail.com system was “going awav” anc ?                                 b7C
following t he initiation of the new domain, Abedin did not have access to her clintonemail.com
account.120

                                                                 This is consistent with
representations made by Williams & Connolly, which stated in a February 22, 2016 letter:
“Secretary Clinton did not transfer her clintonemail.com e-mails for the time period January 21,
2009 through February 1, 2013 to her hrcoffice.com account.. ,” 123 The investigation found no
evidence Clinton's hrcoffice.com account contained or contains potentially classified
information or e-mails from her tenure as Secretary of State. The FBI has, therefore, not
requested or obtained equipment associated with Clinton's hrcoffice.com account.

D.        (U//FOUO) Mobile Devices Associated with Clinton's E-mail Server Systems

(U//F0UO) Clinton stated she used a personal e-mail address and personal BlackBerry for both
personal and official business and this decision was made out of convenience.124Abedin recalled
that at the start of Clinton's tenure, State advised personal e-mail accounts could not be linked to
State mobile devices and, as a result, Clinton decided to use a personal device in order to avoid
carrying multiple devices.125                                                                I_____                                 b3

                I12' Cooper stated that he was aware of Clinton using a second mobile phone
number.s’128 Cooper indicated Clinton usually carried a flip phone along with her BlackBerry
because it was more comfortable for communication and Clinton was able to use her BlackBerry
while talking on the flip phone.129 Clinton believed 2121           Iwas her primary BlackBerry                                     b6

her service in the Senate.1,130 Abedin and Mills advised they were unaware of Clinton ever using
a cellular phone other than the BlackBerry.131’132

(U//FOU0) FBI investigation identified 13 total mobile devices, associated with her two known
phone numbers, 212________ and 212^               which potentially were used to send e-mails                                       b6

two e-mail capable mobile devices associated with 212              after her tenure.u’135 On

Cooper recognized the phone number as Clinton's second number; however the correct phone number is 21 j                    |       b6
*(U//FOUO) AT&T toll records associated with 21                Indicated the number was consistently used for phone calls in       b7C
2009 and then used sporadically tMoughthe duration of Clinton's tenure and the years following. Records also showed that no
BlackBerry devices were associated with tMs phone number.
u (U//FOITO) The FBI identified four additional mobile devices associated with 212|          I which were used during Clinton's
tenure. However, these devices lacked e-mail capability, and as a result the FBI did not conduct any further investigation
regarding these devices.
