tenure; however, Clinton's staffw declined the offer.163 According to
________State S/ES-IRM, Clinton was offered a State e-mail address, but instead decided to use                                       b6
the personal server from her 2008 presidential campaign.*x’164 Investigation identified the                                          b7C
existence of two State-issued e-mail accounts associated with Clinton; however, these accounts
were used on Clinton's behalf and not by Clinton herself. According to State, SMSGS@state.gov
was used to send e-mail messages from the Secretary to all State employees.165,166 This account
was not configured to receive e-mails, and S/ES-IRM authored the messages sent from this
account.167 S/ES-IRM created SSHRC@state.gov to manage an Outlook calendar for Clinton,
but this account was not configured to send or receive e-mails other than calendar
invitations.168 169 A May 25, 2016 report issued by the State Office of Inspector General (OIG)y
stated that, during Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, the State Foreign Affairs Manual
(FAM) required day-to-day operations at State be conducted using an authorized information
system. 170 The OIG stated it found “no evidence” that Clinton sought approval to conduct State
business via her personal e-mail account or private servers, despite her obligation to do so.171
Clinton told the FBI that she did not explicitly request permission from State to use a private
server or e-mail address.172 According to the State OIG report. State employees alleged that John
Bentel, then-Director of S/ES-IRM, discouraged employees from raising concerns about
Clinton's use of personal e-mail.z’173 When interviewed by the FBI, Bentel denied that State
employees raised concerns about Clinton's e-mail to him, that he discouraged employees from
discussing it, or that he was aware during Clinton's tenure that she was using a personal e-mail
account or server to conduct official State business.174

(U//T0U6 ) The FBI investigation determined some Clinton aides and senior-level State
employees were aware Clinton used a personal e-mail address for State business during her
tenure. Clinton told the FBI it was common knowledge at State that she had a private e-mail
address because it was displayed to anyone with whom she exchanged e-mails.175 However,
some State employees interviewed by the FBI explained that e-mails from Clinton17/;     only
                                                                                          1 170
contained the letter “H” in the sender field and did not display her e-mail address. ’ ’ The
majority of the State employees interviewed by the FBI who were in e-mail contact with Clinton
indicated they had no knowledge of the private server in her Chappaqua
residence.179,180,181,182,183,184 Clinton's immediate aides, to include Mills, Abedin, Jacob
Sullivan,aa and|           |told the FBI they were unaware of the existence of the private server until                               b6

after Clinton's tenure at State or when it became public knowledge.185186187188

and could not specifically identify the members of Clinton's immediate staff with whom they spoke.

UNCLASSIFIED and SECRET networks for the Executive Secretariat.                                                                       b7C
y (U//FOUO) Independent of the FBI's investigation, in April 2015, the State OIG initiated its own investigation and review of
records management policies and practices regarding the use of non-State communications systems during the tenure of five
Secretaries of State, including Clinton. Portions of the State OIG's May 25, 2016 report relevant to the FBI1s investigation are
cited herein.
z (U) According to the State OIG report, two State information management staff members approached the Director of the S/ES-
IRM in 2010 with concerns they had about Clinton1s use of a personal e-mail account and compliance with federal records
requirements. According to one staff member, the Director stated that Clinton's personal system had been reviewed and approved
by State legal staff. The Director allegedly told both staff members never to discuss Clinton1s personal e-mail system again. OIG
found no evidence that State legal staff reviewed or approved Clinton's personal e-mail system.
33 (U) Sullivan served as the Deputy Chief of Staff and later the Director of Policy and Planning during Clinton1s tenure as
Secretary of State.
