State OIG Report, IRM introduced SMART throughout State in 2009; however, the Office of the
Secretary elected not to use the SMART system to preserve e-mails, partly due to concerns that
the system would “allow overly broad access to sensitive materials.”21__________ told the FBI                               b6
                                                                                                                            b7C
that representatives from the Executive Secretariat asked to be the last to receive the SMART
rollout, and ultimately SMART was never rolled out to the Executive Secretariat Office. This
left the “print and file” method as the only approved method by which the Office of the Secretary
could preserve record e-mails.213

(U//FQE1Q) Mills wrote in a letter to State, dated December 5, 2014, that it was Clinton's
practice to e-mail State officials at their government e-mail accounts for official business, and,
therefore, State already had records of Clinton's e-mails preserved within State recordkeeping
systems. 1 14 Abedin also stated in her FBI interview that Clinton's staff believed relevant e-mails
would be captured and preservedI 1C
                                    by State if any of the senders or recipients were using an
official State e-mail account. The State OIG stated in its report that this was not an appropriate
method of preserving record e-mails, and Clinton should have preserved any record e-mails
created and received on her personal account by printing and filing the e-mails in the Office of
the Secretary.216 State OIG also determined Clinton should have surrendered all e-mails relating
to State business before leaving her post as Secretary of State.217 Clinton stated that she received
no instructions or direction regarding the preservation or production of records from State during
the transition out of her role as Secretary of State in early 2013.218 Furthermore, Clinton believed
her work-related e-mails were captured by her practice of sending e-mails to State employees'
official State e-mail accounts. 219

B.       (U//FOUO) Communications Equipment in Clinton's State Office and Residences

(U/7FOUO) Investigation determined Clinton did not have a computer in her State office, which
was located in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) on the seventh floor of
                                                                            99H 991 9 9 9
State headquarters, in an area often referred to as “Mahogany Row.” ’ ’ State Diplomatic
Security Service (DS) instructed Clinton that because her office was in a SCIF, the use of mobile
devices in her office was prohibited.223 Interviews of three former DS agents revealed Clinton
stored her personal BlackBerry          in a desk drawer in DS “Post l,”cc which was located within the
                            9 9 a 9 7 C 9 9A
SCIF on Mahogany Row. ’ ’ State personnel were not authorized to bring their mobile
devices into Post 1, as it was located within the SCIF.227 According to Abedin, Clinton primarily
used her personal BlackBerry or personal iPad for checking e-mails, and she left the SCIF to do
so, often visiting State's eighth floor balcony.228 Former Assistant Secretary of State for DS Eric
Boswell stated he never received any complaints about Clinton using her personal BlackBerry
inside the SCIF.229

_________ jThis decision was relayed to Clinton's executive staff via a memo titled “Use of
Blackberries in Mahogany Row,” dated March 6, 2009.232 Clinton stated to the FBI that she
requested a secure BlackBerry while at State after hearing President Obama had one, but she

               The DS security detachment maintained a Post, known as Post 1, located in the SCIF and directly outside of
Clinton's office on Mahogany Row.
