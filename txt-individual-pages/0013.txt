 tenure at State, Clinton's executive staff also inquired about the possibility of the Secretary using
 an iPad to receive communications in her office; however, this request was also denied due to
 restrictions associated with the Secretary's office being in a SCIF.234 According to the State OIG
 report, in January 2009, in response to Clinton's desire to take her BlackBerry into secure areas,
 Mills discussed with S/ES-IRM officials and with the State Under Secretary for Management,
 Patrick Kennedy, alternative solutions which would allow Clinton to check e-mail from her
 desk.235 Setting up an Internet-connected, stand-alone computer was discussed as a viable
 solution; however, a stand-alone system was never set up.236

 contact with Clinton through her personal clintonemail.com e-mail account during her tenure at
 State. Thirteen individuals, consisting of State senior-level employees, work-related advisors,
 and State executive administrative staff, maintained direct e-mail contact with Clinton and
 individually e-mailed her between 100 and 1,000 times during her tenure.11Abedin, Mills, and
 Sullivan, were most frequently in e-mail contact with Clinton and accounted for 68 percent of the
 e-mails sent directly to Clinton. In addition to sending Clinton messages they wrote, Abedin,
 Mills, and Sullivan reviewed e-mails they received from other State employees, USG contacts,
 and foreign government contacts, and if deemed appropriate they then forwarded the information
