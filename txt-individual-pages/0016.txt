2014, Mills and Samuelson asked                to provide a full export of all of Clinton's e-mails
from her tenure, to include e-mails sent to and received from non-.gov e-mail addresses.294,295,296                            b6

create the export of Clinton's e-mails from her tenure.301,302,303

(U//FOUQ) The FBI interviewed Samuelson on May 24, 2016 about her review of the PRN-
provided e-mails. Samuelson indicated she conducted the review of these e-mails over the course
of several months and completed it just prior to December 5, 2014, when hard copies of the
work-related e-mails were turned over to State.304Using her laptop to conduct the review,
Samuelson placed any work-related e-mails into a folder that she had created in Microsoft
Outlook.305 Samuelson first added to this folder all e-mails sent to or from Clinton's personal e-
mail account with gov and .mil e-mail addresses.306 Samuelson then searched the remaining e-
mails for the names of State senior leadership, as well as any members of Congress, foreign
leaders, or other official contacts.307 Finally, Samuelson conducted a key word search of terms
such as “Afghanistan,” “Libya,” and “Benghazi”*4,308 Samuelson reviewed the “To,” “From,”
and “Subject” fields of every e-mail during this review; however, she did not read the content of
each individual e-mail, indicating that, in some instances, she made a determination as to
whether it was one of Clinton's work or personal e-mails by only reviewing the “To,” “From,”
and “Subject” fields of the e-mail.309

(U//FOU0 ) As she completed the review, Samuelson printed all of the e-mails to be turned over
to State using a printer in Mills' s office.310 According to Samuelson, Mills and Kendall
subsequently reviewed e-mails that Samuelson printed, and any hard copy of an e-mail Mills and
Kendall deemed not to be work-related was shredded, and the digital copy of the e-mail was not
included in the folder Samuelson created in Microsoft Outlook to contain all of the work-related
e-mails.311 Mills stated that, other than instances where Samuelson requested Mills' s guidance.
Mills did not review the e-mails Samuelson identified as work-related, and once the review was
complete, Samuelson printed the work-related e-mails.312 After the review was completed,
Samuelson created a PST file containing all of the work-related e-mails and ensured that all
work-related e-mails were printed.313 This .PST file was provided to Kendall on a USB thumb

Clinton1s other attorneys due to an assertion of privilege.
