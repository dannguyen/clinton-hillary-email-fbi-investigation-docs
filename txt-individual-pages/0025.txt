provided reasons why the e-mails may have been sent by him or others on unclassified
systems.458 With respect to the SAP, Sullivan stated that it was discussed on unclassified systems
due to the operational tempo at that time, and State employees attempted to talk around classified
information.459 Sullivan also indicated that, for some of the e-mails, information about the
incidents described therein may have already appeared in news reports.460 Furthermore, Sullivan
stated that his colleagues at State worked hard while under pressure and used their best judgment
to accomplish their mission.461 When forwarding e-mails, Sullivan relied on the judgment of the
individuals who sent the e-mails to him to ensure that the e-mails did not contain classified
information.462 Sullivan did not recall any instances in which he felt uneasy about information
conveyed on unclassified systems, nor any instances in which others expressed concerns about
the handling of classified information at State.000,463

(S//0C/NF) Sullivan was also asked about an e-mail exchange between him and Clinton in
which, on the morning of June 17, 2011, Clinton asked Sullivan to check on the status of talking
points she was supposed to have received.464 Sullivan responded that the secure fax was
malfunctioning but was in the process of being fixed. Clinton instructed Sullivan that if the
secure fax could not be fixed, he should “turn [the talking points] into nonpaper [with] no
identifying heading and send nonsecure.” 465 State uses the term “non-paper” to refer to a
document which is authorized for distribution to a foreign government without explicit
attribution to the U S. government and without classified information. Sullivan did not recall
this specific e-mail but believed that Clinton's request indicated that she would have wanted him                                      bl

(U//FQUO) On April 5, 2016, Abedin, who served as Deputy Chief of Staff to Clinton at State
between 2009 and 2013, was interviewed by the FBI. When asked about an e-mail subsequently
determined to contain CONFIDENTIAL information, Abedin noted that she had only conveyed
the information from the e-mail and had not originated it.470 She also stated that she relied upon
the sender to properly mark the e-mail for classification purposes and did not take it upon herself
to question the sender's judgment as to such marking.ppp>471

(U//FOUO) Investigation determined Sidney Blumenthal, a former political aide to President
Clinton and an informal political advisor to Clinton during her tenure at State, had direct e-mail
contact with Clinton during her tenure at State. FBI investigation identified at least 179 e-


000 (U//FQUO) Abedin and Mills also provided similar responses when asked about State security practices regarding classified
information.
ppp (U//TOUO) Although Abedin was a party to e-mails containing information that has since been determined to be classified,
due to the nature of her position at Slate, Abedin was not regularly included in the e-mail chains (discussed in this section of the
memorandum) about which Sullivan and Mills were questioned. Abedin's position at State did not consistently involve her
participation in substantive policy decisions, and she was not a regular user of classified e-mail systems.
