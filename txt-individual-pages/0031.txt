       (U//FOUO) On March 11, 2011, Boswell sent a memo directly to Clinton outlining an increase
       since January 2011 of cyber actors targeting State employees' personal e-mail accounts.563 The
       memo included an attachment which urged State employees to limit the use of personal e-mail
       for official business since “some compromised home systems have been reconfigured by these
       actors to automatically forward copies of all composed e-mails to an undisclosed recipient.”564
       Clinton's immediate staff was also briefed on cybersecurity threats in April and May 2011.565

       mmmm(U) In order for malicious executables to be effective, the targeted host device has to have the correct program/applications
       installed. If, for example, the host is running an older version of Adobe but the exploit being used is newer, there is a chance the
       host will not be infected because the exploit was unable to execute using the older version of the program.
       'm m (U) A “drop” account, in this case, is an e-mail account controlled by foreign cyber actors and which serves as the recipient
       of auto-forwarded e-mails from victim accounts.
