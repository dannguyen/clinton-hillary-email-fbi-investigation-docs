Server6 in the basement of the Chappaqua residence.6,7 The FBI was unable to obtain records
from Cooper or Apple to verify the installation. At the time. Cooper was the only individual with
administrative access to the Apple Server; however, the Clinton family and their Chappaqua
residence staff had physical access to the Apple Server.8,9 The Apple Server initially hosted the
domains presidentclinton.com and wicoffice.com. which were used by President Clinton's
staff/’10,11

(U//F0 U 8 ) Prior to January 21, 2009, when she was sworn in as the US Secretary of State,
Clinton used a personally-acquired BlackBerry device with service initially from Cingular
Wireless and later AT&T Wireless, to access her e-mail accounts.12,13 Clinton initially used the
e-mail addresses hrl5@mvcin2ular.blackberrv.net and then changed to
hr 15@att.blackberry.net.14,15 According to Cooper, in January 2009, Clinton decided to stop
using her hrl 5@att.blackberrv.net e-mail address and instead began using a new private domain,
clintonemail.com. to host e-mail service on the Apple Server.16 Clinton stated to the FBI that she
directed aides, in or around January 2009, to create the clintonemail.com account, and as a
matter of convenience her clintonemail.com account was moved to an e-mail system maintained
by President Clinton's aides.17 While Cooper could not specifically recall registering the domain.
Cooper was listed as the point of contact for clintonemail.com when the domain was registered
with a domain registration services company. Network Solutions, on January 13, 2009.18,19
Clinton used her att.blackberrv.net e-mail account as her primary e-mail address until
approximately mid-to-late January 2009 when she transitioned to her newly created
hdr22@clintonemail.com account.20,21 The FBI did not recover any information indicating that
Clinton sent an e-mail from her hr 15@att.blackberrv.net e-mail after March 18, 2009.

(U//F0U©) According to Cooper, in or around January 2009 the decision was made to move to
another server because the Apple Server was antiquated and users were experiencing problems
with e-mail delivery on their BlackBerry devices.22,23 At the recommendation of Huma Abedin,
Clinton's long-time aide and later Deputy Chief of Staff at State, in or around fall 2008, Cooper
contacted Bryan Pagliano, who worked on Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign as an
information technology specialist, to build the new server system and to assist Cooper with the
administration of the new server system.24,25,26,27 Pagliano was in the process of liquidating the
computer equipment from Clinton's presidential campaign when Cooper contacted Pagliano
about using some of the campaign's computer equipment to replace the existing Apple Server at
Clinton's Chappaqua residence.28,29 Pagliano was unaware the server would be used by Clinton
at the time he was building the server system; rather, he believed the server would be used by
President Clinton's staff30 Clinton told the FBI that at some point she became aware there was a
server in the basement of her Chappaqua residence.31 However, she was unaware of the
transition from the Apple Server managed by Cooper to another server built by Pagliano and
therefore, was not involved in the transition decision.32
