(U//FOUO) Between the fall of 2008 and January 2009, Pagliano requisitioned the original
hardware for the second e-mail server from Clinton's presidential campaign headquarters in
Arlington, VA.33 In addition to hardware acquired from Clinton's presidential campaign,
Pagliano and Cooper8 purchased additional necessary equipment through commercial
vendors.34,35,36,37 In March 2009, after Pagliano had acquired all of the server equipment and
installed the necessary software, he and Cooper met at Clinton's Chappaqua residence to
physically install the server and related equipment in a server rack in the Clintons'
basement.11,38,39

(U//FOUO) Once the new server system*1was physically installed and powered on, Pagliano
began migrating the e-mail data from the Apple Server to the Pagliano-administered server
system (Pagliano Server).40 Pagliano believed he “popped out” all of the e-mail from the Apple
Server and that no e-mail content should have remained on the Apple Server once the migration
took place.41 Pagliano stated to the FBT that he only transferred clintonemail.com e-mail
accounts for Abedin anq                    'rom the Apple Server and said he was unaware of and                                          b6
                                                                                                                                         b7C
did not transfer an e-mail account for Clinton.^42 However, Cooper stated to the FBI that he
believed Clinton had a clintonemail.com e-mail account on the Apple Server, and that Abedin
did not have a clintonemail.com account on the Apple Server.43 As the FBI was unable to obtain
the original Apple Server for a forensic review for reasons explained below, the FBI cannot
determine which clintonemail.com e-mail accounts were hosted on, and transferred from, the
Apple Server to the Pagliano Server.

(U//FOUO) After the e-mail account migration was completed. Cooper changed the Mail
Exchange (MX) recordsk to ensure that delivery of all subsequent e-mail to or from e-mail
addresses on the presidentclinton.com and clintonemail.com domains would be directed toward
the new Pagliano Server instead of the Apple Server.44 The Pagliano Server was only used for e-
mail management, and the FBI's review of the oldest available backup image of this server,
dated June 24, 2013, did not indicate that any e-mail users' files were stored on the Pagliano
Server.45

(U//FOU0) In March 2009, following the e-mail migration from the Apple Server to the
Pagliano Server, the Annie Server was repurposed to serve as a personal computer for household
                                                                                                                                         b6

h (LV/rOL'Q) Pagliano visited Clinton's Chappaqua residence on at least three occasions to work on the server: in March 2009, to
install the server; in June 2011, to upgrade the equipment; and in January 2012, to fix a hardware issue.
1(U//FOUO) The Pagliano Server initially consisted of the following equipment: a Dell PowerEdge 2900 server running
Microsoft Exchange for e-mail hosting and management, a Dell PowerEdge 1950 server running BlackBerry Enterprise Server
(BES) for the management of BlackBerry devices, a Seagate external hard drive to store backups of the Dell PowerEdge 2900
server, a Dell switch, a Cisco firewall, and a power supply.
j (U//FOU0) An e-mail obtained during the FBI investigation from Cooper to Clinton, indicated that in April 2009, Cooper was
preparing to update Clinton's BlackBerry to “put it on our new system.”
k (U) An MX record determines which server will handle e-mail delivery for a domain and is necessary for routing e-mail to its
proper destination.
