F.       (U//FOUO) Clinton's Production of E-mail in Response to FOIA and Other Requests

(U//FOUO) The House Select Committee on Benghazi was established on May 8, 2014 and
reached an agreement with State on July 23, 2014 regarding the production of records.280 State
sent a formal request to former Secretaries of State on October 28, 2014, asking them to produce
e-mails related to their government work.281 After State requested that Clinton provide her e-
mails,1111Clinton asked her attorneys, David Kendall00 and Mills, to oversee the process of
providing Clinton's work-related e-mails to State.282 Heather Samuelson,pp an attorney working
with Mills, undertook a review to identify work-related e-mails, while Kendall and Mills
oversaw the process.283 Ultimately, on December 5, 2014, Williams & Connolly provided
approximately 55,000 pages of e-mailsqq to State in response to State's request for Clinton to
produce all e-mail in her possession that constituted a federal record from her tenure as Secretary
of State.284 State ultimately reviewed the 55,000 pages of e-mail to meet its production
obligations related to FOIA lawsuits and requests. On May 27, 2015, State received a court order
to post Clinton's e-mails to the State FOIA website on a monthly production schedule with a
completion date of January 29, 2016. State ultimately concluded its FOIA-related production
on February 29, 2016. Clinton told the FBI that she directed her legal team to provide any work-
related or arguably work-related e-mails to State; however she did not participate in the
development of the specific process to be used or in discussions of the locations of where her e-
mails might exist.286 Clinton was not consulted on specific e-mails in order to determine if they
were work-related.287
