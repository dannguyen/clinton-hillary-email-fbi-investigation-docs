(U//FOUO) According to Hanley, in spring 2013, Cooper assisted Hanley in creating an archive
of Clinton's e-mails.315 Cooper provided Hanley with an Apple MacBook laptop (the Archive
Laptop)uu from the Clinton Foundation and telephonically walked Hanley through the process of
remotely transferring Clinton's e-mails from the Pagliano Server to the laptop and a thumb
drive.310 Hanley completed this task from her personal residence.317 The two copies of the
Clinton e-mail archive (one on the Archive Laptop and one on the thumb drive) were intended to
be stored in Clinton's Chappaqua and Whitehaven residences; however, Hanley explained this
did not occur as Hanley forgot to provide the Archive Laptop and the thumb drive to Clinton's
staff following the creation of the archive. 318,319 In early 2014, Hanley located the Archive

however, she advised that Clinton's staff was moving offices at the time, and it would have been
easy for the package to get lost during the transition period.338 Neither Hanley noi
could identify the current whereabouts of the Archive Laptop or thumb drive containing the
archive, and the FBI does not have either item in its possession.339

(U//FOUO) FBI investigation identified 940 e-mails associated with Clinton's personal e-mail

uu (U//rOUO) According to Abedin, the archive of Clinton's e-mails was created as a reference for the future production of a
book. According to Hanley, the archive of Clinton1s e-mails was created in response to Clinton1s hdr22@clintonemail.com
address being released to the public following the online posting of e-mail exchanges between Clinton and an informal political
advisor, Sidney Blumenthal. Blumenthal1s personal e-mail account, which contained his e-mails with Clinton, was compromised
on March 14, 2013 by a Romanian cyber hacker. See Section 4.D.
