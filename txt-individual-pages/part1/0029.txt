of malware.526

(U//FOUO) On January 9, 2011, Cooper sent Abedin an e-mail stating someone was attempting
to “hack” the server, prompting him to shut it down.527 Cooper sent Abedin another e-mail later
the same day stating he had to reboot the server again.528 The FBI's investigation did not identify
successful malicious login activity associated with this incident.529

(U//FOU0) The FBI's review of available Internet Information Services (IIS) web logs showed
scanning attempts from external IP addresses over the course of Pagliano's administration of the
server, though only one appears to have resulted in a successful compromise of an e-mail
account on the server.530 Forensic analysis noted that on January 5, 2013, three IP addresses
matching known Torffff exit nodes were observed accessing a user e-mail account on the
Pagliano Server believed to belong to President Clinton staffer!                   IFBI                                                 b6

revealed multiple instances of potential malicious actors attempting to exploit vulnerabilities on

(U//FOUO) Following the March 3, 2015 New York Times article publicly revealing Clinton's

have remedied these vulnerabilities, exposing RDP to direct connections could allow remote attackers the opportunity to guess
