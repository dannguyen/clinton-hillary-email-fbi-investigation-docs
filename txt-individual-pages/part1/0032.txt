(U//FOU©) On or about March 14, 2013, Blumenthal's AOL e-mail account was compromised
by Marcel Lehel Lazar, aka Guccifer, a Romanian cyber hacker. Lazar disseminated e-mails and
attachments sent between Blumenthal and Clinton to 31 media outlets including a Russian
                                                                                                                                        b7E

screenshots captured a list of 19 foreign policy and intelligence memos authored by Blumenthal
for Clinton.589 The content of one of the memos on the list was determined by State to be
classified at the CONFIDENTIAL level.590 Lazar was extradited from Romania to the United
States on March 31, 2016.591

(U//FOUO) Between April 25, 2016 and May 2, 2016, Lazar made a claim to FOX News that he
used information from Blumenthal's compromise as a stepping stone to hack Clinton's personal
server.592 On May 26, 2016, the FBI interviewed Lazar, who admitted he lied to FOX News
about hacking the Clinton server.593 FBI forensic analysis of the Clinton server during the
timeframe Lazar claimed to have compromised the server did not identify evidence that Lazar
hacked the server.594 An examination of log files from March 2013 indicated that IP addresses
from Russia and Ukraine attempted to scan the server on March 15, 2013, the day after the
Blumenthal compromise, and on March 19 and March 21, 2013.595 However, none of these
attempts were successful, and it could not be determined whether this activity was attributable to

(U//FOUO) FBI extracted the Thread-Index0000 and Message-IDPPPPvalues for each identified
confirmed classified e-mail relevant to this investigation. The values were extracted from the e-
mail headersqqqq in order to develop specific electronic signatures that could be used when
searching for exact references in large data repositories. In an effort to identify whether any
confirmed classified e-mails may have been compromised through computer intrusion methods,
the FBI conducted signature-based searches in available databases, to includ|                 [rr. The                                  b7E
FBI also provided the unique identifiers to other government agencies, and one entity

0000 (U) A Thread-Index value is a unique, alphanumeric, Microsoft Outlook-centric field found in an e-mail's header. The
identifier is used to track e-mail threads (or conversations). Each time there is a reply or forward in the e-mail thread, Outlook—
if it is the e-mail client being used—will append additional alphanumeric characters to the e-mail's original Thread-Index value.
pppp (U) A Message-ID is a unique identifier found in an e-mail's header. Message-IDs are required to have a specific format and

be globally unique. Unlike Thread-Index values, Message-IDs are unique to every individual e-mail, regardless of whether two e-
mails belong to the same thread (or conversation).
qqqq (jj) A header precedes the body (content text) of an e-mail, and contains lines (metadata) that identify particular routing
information. Fields such as “From.” “To.” and “Date” are mandatory, while others are optional.
