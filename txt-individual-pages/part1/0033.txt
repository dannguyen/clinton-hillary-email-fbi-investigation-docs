responded.ssss To date, the signature-based searches in USG databases have not identified the
relevant e-mails.601




ssss (U//FQTO) The FBI provided the Executive Office of the President (EOP), State Cyber Threat Analysis Division (CTAD),
and State's Information Resource Bureau (IRB) with Thread-Index and Message-ID values. CTAD found no record of the
signatures provided. EOP stated they could only search “To,” “From,” and “Subject” lines, as did State IRB. Separately, in an
attempt to identify whether confirmed classified e-mails resided in unidentified e-mail provider accounts, or whether identified
accounts forwarded or replied to the classified messages, the FBI explored the possibility of sharing Thread-Index Value and
Message-IDs with e-mail service providers of interest. Google was asked if they could search those header fields in its dataset.
The company stated it does not index Thread-Index values, which is the identifier the FBI was most interested in, as it would
have provided insight into the extent the messages were forwarded.
