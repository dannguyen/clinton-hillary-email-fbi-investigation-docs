                       (U/ffiOUO) Upon taking office as the Secretary of State (SeeState) at the O.S. Department .ofState
               (hereafter. State) in January 2609, CLINTON recalled her office on the seventh floor at State headquarters
               had one Mack phone capable of unseeure and secure communications, one yellow phone for secure
               communication-only, and one white phone capable of direct calls to certain government officials.
               CLINTON, did not ha ve a computer terminal of any kind or a. facsimile machine in her office at State.
               Additionally, State out fitted CLIN'TON’S residences in Washington, DC and Chappaqua, New York with
               a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SOF). Each SOP had a combination lock that only
               CLINTON knew the combination to. The SCIFs in both residences were outfitted with secure video
               teleconference equipment, and the same phone systems as in her office at State. CLINTON did not have a
               ■computer terminal of any kind in the SCIFs at her residences, but did have a facsimile machine capable of
               .secure and unsecure transmission. CLINTON rarely used the SCIF in her residence in DC, primarily due
               to her preference to use her office at State. It was CLINTONS practice to lock the SOF every time It: was
               vacated. When in her residences, CLINTON would receive classified Information through diplomatic
               pouch via courier, secure phone call or secure lux. After consuming hard copy classilied docuntents at her
